            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT hath pleaſed God, that the <hi>hearts</hi> of moſt men at this preſent juncture (or at leaſt their <hi>faces</hi>) are ſet upon <hi>Union</hi> of the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> and it is abſolutely neceſſary that ſomewhat be done in order to a firm and laſting one among us. Upon this point on all hands we ſeem to be agreed, We muſt Unite or we muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done: but as for the means of obtaining this end, the differences are many.</p>
            <p>Some among the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> ſeem to propoſe an Execution of the Poenal Laws, as a ſure way of Uniting us: Others (as this <hi>Author</hi> of Dean <hi>Stillingfleets</hi> Defence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) inſiſt on a <hi>Submiſſion to the Biſhops</hi> of the <hi>Univerſal Church</hi> to be the onely foundation of Unity in the Church. The <hi>Diſſenters</hi> differ from ſuch as are of theſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and in the general aſſert, That if ever an Union be obtained, it muſt be by an Inſiſting onely on a <hi>Few, Certain, Neceſſary</hi> things as terms of Communion. That the utmoſt ſeverities of the Magiſtrate will rather, fill the minds of the Sufferers with Prejudices, againſt the Dictates of thoſe men whoſe moſt powerful Argument is the Sword, than Inlighten their Judgments, or Diſpoſe their Souls to any ſincere Compliances; and that the Notion of our Author, to wit, the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Dean of <hi>Pauls,</hi> is <hi>Schiſmatical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this account it is not a little time is ſpent in a Repreſenting the ſeveral Notions there are about the methods of Uniting us to be Ineffectual, the one Party miſliking the Propoſals made by the Other. But ſurely this is not the way to heal our breaches, or put an end to the Warme and Indecent Conteſts, that have been among us. For which Reaſon, though my principal aime is for Union, yet will not I <hi>preſume</hi> on any thing propoſed by us. I will onely acquaint the <hi>Reader</hi> with the Nature of the <hi>Ancient Conſtitution</hi> of our <hi>Government</hi> in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> to <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Affairs,</hi> and thereby ſhew what will moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually conduce to Unite us in a way the <hi>leaſt novel,</hi> and <hi>moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent</hi> with our Civil Eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>The which I can no ſooner compaſs, but I ſhall be capacitated to demonſtrate to the World, That the Principles of the Diſſenter are very
<pb facs="tcp:61768:4"/>much adapted for concord, not onely among <hi>themſelves,</hi> but with the moderate <hi>Epiſcoparians,</hi> and very advantagious to the <hi>State</hi> in which they live.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ancient Conſtitution</hi> of our Government about Matters Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, is very excellently deſcrib'd in the <hi>Neceſſary Doctrine, and Erudition of a Chriſtian man</hi> compoſed by ſeveral Biſhops, and other great Doctors, and approved by Authority in the days of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Judicious Tractate 'tis manifeſt</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That Church Government is <hi>Jure Divino.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> That to the Conſtituting ſuch a Church Government thoſe Church Officers onely are neceſſary who are mention'd in the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> That in the New Teſtament there is mention made of no other Church Officers, but <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Deacons.</hi> That no other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is of Divine Right, but what is under the Conduct of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> or <hi>Prieſts,</hi> i. e. <hi>Elders,</hi> is evident, in that the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> mentioneth no other Governours, as Eccleſiaſtical, but the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, or Elders; whence, that Government, whoſe Conſtitution is ſuch, as that it becomes a Government on no other account, than that the Governours are of <hi>humane make,</hi> that Government cannot, formally conſidered, be of Divine Right, 'tis but <hi>Humane,</hi> though <hi>circa Sacra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> That <hi>Biſhops,</hi> or <hi>Prieſts,</hi> the ſole Governours of the Church are of <hi>one,</hi> and the <hi>ſame Order,</hi> their Power the ſame, their work the ſame, which is to preach the Word, Adminiſter Sacraments, and Exerciſe Diſcipline</p>
            <p>All this I collect from what is aſſerted in the aforeſaid <hi>Neceſſary Erudition</hi> about the Sacrament of <hi>Orders,</hi> where 'tis ſaid, <hi>That Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, or Prieſts, and Deacons are the onely Orders mention'd in the New Teſtament.</hi> And <hi>of theſe two ORDERS</hi> onely, <hi>that is to ſay,</hi> Prieſts, and Deacons, <hi>Scripture maketh expreſs mention. That all others were afterward added by the Church. That the Duty,</hi> and <hi>Office of the</hi> Biſhop, Prieſt, [or Elder] <hi>conſiſteth in true Preaching and Teaching the word of God unto the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in Diſpenſing, and Miniſtring the Sacraments of Chriſt;</hi> in Loſing, and Aſſoiling from ſin, <hi>ſuch perſons as be ſorry</hi> and <hi>truly Penitent for the ſame,</hi> and <hi>EXCOMMUNICATING ſuch, as BE GUILTY IN MANIFEST CRIMES, and WILL NOT BE
<pb facs="tcp:61768:4"/>REFORMED OTHERWISE,</hi> and <hi>finally, in Praying for the Whole Church of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>ſpecially for the flock, committed unto 'em.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Order of a Biſhop, or Prieſt is one and the ſame; whoſe Office is, not onely to Preach, and Adminiſter Sacraments, but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over to <hi>exerciſe Diſcipline,</hi> namely in Loſing, and <hi>Aſſoiling from ſin, ſuch perſons as be ſorry, and truly Penitent,</hi> and in <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating the Obſtinately Vitious,</hi> As much as if it had been ſaid, that Church Government, and the Office of a Biſhop, or Elder, is of Divine Right.</p>
            <p>The Office of the <hi>Deacons</hi> in the Primitive Church was <hi>partly in Miniſtring Meat, and Drink, and other Neceſſaries to the poor people found of the Church, partly alſo in Miniſtring to the Biſhops, and Prieſts, and in doing their duty in the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereby 'tis apparent that <hi>Deacons,</hi> as they were not by Office Preachers, nor Diſpenſers of the Sacraments, neither were they Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church. The Government of the Church being commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto the Biſhops, or Presbyters <hi>onely.</hi> The which being ſo, 'twill as I humbly apprehend, follow, That <hi>Church Government,</hi> according to Chriſts Inſtitution, <hi>was ſeated in thoſe Particular Societies,</hi> which were under the care, and conduct of Biſhops, or Elders, every ſuch ſociety, call it <hi>Parochial;</hi> or <hi>Congregational,</hi> being a Compleat Goſpel Church, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> a Church whoſe Elders, or Biſhops have as Entire a power for the Exerciſe of Diſcipline in their Congregations, as for the Diſpenſing the word or Adminiſtring the Sacraments. This is not onely to be found in the <hi>Neceſſary Erudition,</hi> but moreover there are Intimations enough in other Diſcourſes publiſhed in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eights time, to incline a Judicious mind to conclude, That the Office of a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>Biſhop</hi> is One, and the ſame; and conſequently that <hi>Particular Parochial,</hi> or <hi>Congregational Churches</hi> are of <hi>Divine Inſtitution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have obſerved in the <hi>Sum of Chriſtianity,</hi> compos'd by <hi>Francis Lambert</hi> of <hi>Avynyon,</hi> a Treatiſe Publiſhed <hi>An. 1536.</hi> That the Notion of the <hi>Sameneſs</hi> of the Order of a Biſhop, or Elder appeared in the world with ſome kind of boldneſs. For although this <hi>Lambert</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> Prince of <hi>Lauſane,</hi> doth aſſert, That there be <hi>MANY Biſhops of ONE</hi> City, <hi>for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>every City hath ſo many Biſhops, as it hath true Evangeliſts,</hi> or <hi>Preachers,</hi> For <hi>every Preacher of the Truth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is a true Biſhop, although
<pb facs="tcp:61768:5"/>he be not call'd ſo of many; Biſhops be only Prophets of Truth, and there ſhould be ſo many Biſhops, as the multitude of People requireth, Verily Every Pariſh ought to have its proper Biſhop.</hi> And in the Treatiſe it ſelf, chap. <hi>5. In every City, Town,</hi> and <hi>Village there ought to be many Biſhops</hi> (i. e.) <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> or <hi>Preachers, after the quantity of places, and multitude of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. If many Pariſhes be ſo great, that one Biſhop is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for them, let them be divided,</hi> and <hi>to every part a Biſhop aſſigned.</hi> This and much more in <hi>Lambert.</hi> Notwithſtanding which, this Treatiſe is publiſhed by <hi>Triſtram Rewell,</hi> and dedicated to <hi>Queen Anne,</hi> wife of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. A thing that would not have been done but that this Opinion was very common at that time, and within ſeven years after declar'd to be the ſenſe of the <hi>Church of England</hi> as I have evinc'd out of the <hi>Neceſſary Erudition.</hi> But</p>
            <p n="5">5. That the <hi>Superiority of one Biſhop over another,</hi> or of a <hi>Biſhop</hi> over a <hi>Presbyter</hi> is of <hi>Humane,</hi> not of <hi>Divine Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dioceſan Biſhops, Metropolitane, or Patriarchal are not found in Sacred writings, and concerning this, the <hi>neceſſary Erudition</hi> is moſt expreſs, in theſe words, And <hi>whereas we have thus ſummarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd what is the Office, and miniſtration, which in Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath been committed to Biſhops, and Prieſts, and in what things it conſiſteth as is before rehearſed,</hi> leſt <hi>peradventure it might be thought to ſome perſons, That ſuch Authorities, Powers,</hi> and <hi>Juriſdictions as</hi> Patriarchs, Primates, Archbiſhops, and Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politanes <hi>now have,</hi> or <hi>heretofore at any time have had Juſtly, and Lawfully over other</hi> Biſhops, <hi>were given them by God in holy Scripture. We think it expedient, and neceſſary, That all men ſhould be advertis'd, and taught, That all ſuch lawful Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Authorities of ANY one Biſhop over another, were, and be given to them, by the Conſent, Ordinance, and Poſitive Laws of men ONELY, AND NOT BY ANY ORDINANCE OF GOD IN HOLY SCRIPTURE.</hi> And <hi>all other Power,</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> which <hi>and Biſhop hath uſed, or exerciſed over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which hath not been given to him by ſuch conſent, and Ordinance of Men,, (as is aforeſaid) is in very deed</hi> no <hi>LAW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FULL POWER,</hi> but <hi>PLAIN USURPATION AND TYRANNY.</hi> So far the <hi>Chriſtian Erudition.</hi> From whence 'tis manifeſt, That according unto them, <hi>Dioceſan Epiſcopacy</hi> is of <hi>Humane Right onely</hi> (i. e.) Any one Biſhops Ruling over another Biſhop, or Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,
<pb facs="tcp:61768:5"/>is what the Scriptures do not direct unto, and conſequently 'tis not of Divine Right, neither is it any further Lawful, than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto the Laws of the Land in which 'tis Exercis'd.</p>
            <p>Though the Power of Dioceſane Biſhops, as 'tis <hi>Circa Sacra,</hi> may be called <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> yet if we conſider its <hi>Origine,</hi> and <hi>Source,</hi> we ſhall find it to be but <hi>Civil,</hi> ſeated <hi>primarily</hi> in the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that 'tis of an <hi>humane make,</hi> and ſo far, but no farther Lawful, than as Sanction'd by the Laws of the Land. <hi>Dioceſane Biſhops</hi> as ſuch are not immediately owing unto God, but unto our Civil Governours for their <hi>Being,</hi> 'tis on them their ſole dependance is, and on them they relie for the Continuance of their Power. The <hi>King, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> aſſembled in <hi>Parliament</hi> can, as they ſee cauſe, make what Alterations they pleaſe in the Epiſcopal, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſan Government, Though they cannot alter any Divine Law, yet they can change any Law that receives its Being from themſelves. Though they cannot alter the Office of a Presbyter, or Biſhop, which receives its Being from the Inſtitution, or Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt, yet they may correct, or amend any thing in the Humane, <hi>viz.</hi> The Dioceſane Conſtitution. They can enlarge, or narrow, any Dioceſs, yea pull down one, and Erect another. They can add unto, or take from the Epiſcopal Juriſdiction, as they judge Expedient.</p>
            <p>That this was the ſenſe of the <hi>Church of England</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8ths.</hi> time, yea and in <hi>moſt ages</hi> ſince an Epiſcopal Government has been eſtabliſhed in this Kingdome, and conſequently the <hi>Antient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi> of our Government, is not only manifeſt, from what hath been already taken out of the <hi>Neceſſary Erudition,</hi> but from other paſſages, that are in that excellent treatiſe, and ſome other Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that I will inſiſt on. As</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>Power,</hi> that hath ever been <hi>acknowledged</hi> to <hi>be ſeated in the Kings of this Realm,</hi> concerning <hi>the exempting any</hi> particular Churches <hi>from an</hi> Epiſcopal Juriſdiction <hi>evinces</hi> it.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Epiſcopal Juriſdiction</hi> be of Divine Right, it lies not in the power of any Prince to alter it, If every Pariſh Presbyter is, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Scriptures, an Officer inferiour to ſome Dioceſane Biſhop, the exempting ſuch a Presbyter from Epiſcopal Juriſdiction is out of the power of any man. 'Twas a known Rule in our Land even in the days of Popery; That no <hi>Law of man can alter,</hi> or <hi>diſanul any Law of God,</hi> If then our Princes ever thought themſelves to have been inveſted with a Power of exempting any Presbyter from Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb facs="tcp:61768:6"/>Juriſdiction, 'tis evident that they look not on that Juriſdiction to be of Divine Right.</p>
            <p>But that our Princes judg'd themſelves to have ſuch a Power, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, from the many Inſtances that can be given of their exerciſing it, Whoſoever conſults the Learned Dr. <hi>Burnets Hiſtory of the Refor. part. 1. lib. 3.</hi> will find, That <hi>Ethelbert</hi> exempted a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtry at <hi>Canterbury</hi> with ſome Churches belonging unto it from the <hi>Juriſdiction of</hi> the <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> and his Succeſſors. King <hi>Ina</hi>'s Charter to the <hi>Abbey</hi> of <hi>Glaſſenbury</hi> exemps them from the Biſhops Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. The like did King <hi>Offa</hi> concerning the Monaſtry of St. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> An. <hi>793. Kenulph</hi> King of <hi>Mercia</hi> that at <hi>Abington</hi> Anno <hi>821.</hi> and <hi>Knut,</hi> that at St. <hi>Edmvndbury</hi> An. <hi>1020.</hi> Yea and there are ſeveral places at this very time exempt from Epiſcopal Juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>Whatever our Princes in after Ages might loſe as to the Exerciſe of their juſt Power, 'tis certain, that <hi>Henry 8th.</hi> reaſſumed it, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by his diſmembring ſome <hi>Dioceſſes,</hi> and by his removing ſome Churches from one Juriſdiction to another. For this Conſult Dr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets Hiſtory of Reformation,</hi> part <hi>1.</hi> lib. <hi>3.</hi> page <hi>301.</hi> where you'l find the Complaint of the <hi>Roman</hi> party beyond the Sea concerning the Kings encroaching on the Juriſdiction of the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>— to which 'twas anſwered, That <hi>the Diviſion of the Eccleſiaſtical Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction whether of Patriarchs, Primates, Metropolitanes, or Biſhops was according to the</hi> Roman <hi>Law Regulated by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, Of which the Antient Councils always approv'd. And in</hi> England <hi>when the Biſhoprick of</hi> Lincoln, <hi>being judg'd of too great an extent, the Biſhoprick of</hi> Ely <hi>was taken out of</hi> it, <hi>it was done only</hi> by the King, <hi>with the conſent of his Clergy,</hi> and <hi>Nobles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis alſo evident out of Dr. <hi>Burnets Hiſt. of the Ref. part 1. l. 3 p. 267.</hi> That this great <hi>Prince</hi> gave cut ſuch a Commiſſion to <hi>Bonner,</hi> and it may be to others alſo, as makes it moſt manifeſt, that <hi>Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan Biſhops</hi> were not of God's, but only of the Magiſtrate's Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Hence <hi>Bonner</hi> in his Commiſſion from the <hi>King</hi> moſt grateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledges that he received it only from the King's bounty, and muſt deliver it up again when it ſhould pleaſe his Majeſty to call for it, even as Juſtices of the Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whoſe Commiſſion is <hi>ad Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citum.</hi> Moreover Lay-men had Eccleſiaſtical Dignities. The <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>Hartford</hi> ſix Prebends promiſſed him, as the Lord <hi>Cromwal</hi> in <hi>H. 8.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:61768:6"/>was made Dean of <hi>Wells.</hi> A thing very ordinary at that time; Dr. <hi>Burnets Hiſt. of the Refor. part 2.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus a Dioceſane Epiſcopacy at beſt was judg'd but an humane Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, owing to the Magiſtrate alone for it's Riſe, and Conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This ſeems to be the ſenſe of the Reformers in <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi> time who were under the Influence of that great Divine, and Bleſſed Martyr <hi>Archbiſhop Cranmer.</hi> In <hi>Henry 8th.</hi> days <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> did his Utmoſt for the promoting a Reformation, the which, he did withal the Speed and Prudence the Ilneſs of the times would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, further attempt to carry on under <hi>King Edward,</hi> and what he did, was ſo highly approv'd of by all, who were hearty for a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that whoever conſiders how Unanimous the truly Proteſtans Biſhops were, in Concurring with this great Prelate <hi>Cranmer,</hi> cannot but encline to think, That their Principles in moſt things about Church Diſcipline were the ſame, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> they were for the Divine Right of Biſhops or Presbyters, even when they judg'd the Superiority of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop to a Presbyter to be but Humane.</p>
            <p>That this may appear to be the ſenſe of <hi>Cranmer,</hi> I will only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech my <hi>Reader</hi> to compare what was done under <hi>King Edw. 6th.</hi> by this great Prelate, with his <hi>Judgment</hi> concerning a Dioceſan Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy under <hi>Henry the 8th.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Henry 8ths.</hi> time <hi>Cranmer</hi> in anſwer to that Queſtion, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhops,</hi> or <hi>Prieſts were firſt?</hi> did aſſert, That <hi>the Biſhops, and Prieſt, were at one time,</hi> and <hi>were no two things, but both</hi> One Office <hi>in the beginning of Chriſts Religion,</hi> That <hi>in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he that is appointed to be a BISHOP or PRIEST, needeth no Couſecration by the Scripture,</hi> for <hi>ELECTION,</hi> or <hi>APPOINT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING thereto is ſufficient.</hi> This was then <hi>Cranmers</hi> Judgment and I cannot underſtand that he did at any time in the leaſt vary from it, for in the <hi>Neceſſary Erudition,</hi> which he ſubſcribed, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing aſſerted, but what is either Conſiſtent with, or an approbation of what was the Archbiſhops: Opinion about theſe points.</p>
            <p>'Tis true <hi>Cranmer</hi> was ſo Zealous an Aſſerter to the <hi>Kings Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,</hi> that he ſeem'd to be of that Opinion, which doth now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the name of <hi>Eraſtianiſme,</hi> for he held, <hi>That a Biſhop, or Prieſt by the Scripture is neither commanded,</hi> nor <hi>forbidden to Excommunicate, but, where the</hi> Laws <hi>of any</hi> Region <hi>give him Authority to Excommunicate, there he ought to uſe the
<pb facs="tcp:61768:7"/>ſame, &amp;c.</hi> But from this he muſt be conſidered to have received, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſubſcribed the Neceſſary <hi>Erudition,</hi> where 'tis expreſt, That a part of the Prieſts or Biſhops Office is according to the Scriptures to Excommunicate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as well as Teach, and Adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>To all this add the <hi>Progreſs Cranmer</hi> made under <hi>Edw. 6.</hi> in the Reformation, how far he went, and how much farther he would have gone, had not the Iniquity of thoſe times been ſo exceeding great, and the Reign of this worthy <hi>Prince</hi> ſo very ſhort. 'Tis well known that he went ſo far as to tempt Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> to conclude King <hi>Edwards</hi> death no <hi>Infelicity</hi> to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and to provoke Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to ſay, That they had ſtript the Church too much of its external Splendour and Magnificence, That twas requiſite to make ſome alteration in the Articles to the end a Compliance of the Roman Catholicks might be more eaſie. What I have inſiſted on in this place about <hi>Cranmer</hi> is taken out of Dr. <hi>Burnets</hi> Hiſtory, and a <hi>Record</hi> in him <hi>ex M.SS.</hi> D. <hi>Stillingfleet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Such is the preſent <hi>Prerogative of his Majeſty</hi> in <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> as well as Civil Affairs, that the aſſerting the Divine Right of a Dioceſane Epiſcopacy is inconſiſtent with it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> is the <hi>Supream Head</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> as well as of the <hi>State;</hi> for which Reaſon, he hath Power to appoint Officers to look after the management of Affairs in the One, as in the Other: But if the Dioceſan Biſhops depend not ſo much on the Prince for their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority and Power in making an Authoritative Inſpection into Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calal Affairs, as the Civil Magiſtrate; who is it that is his Majeſties Commiſſionated Officer about Eccleſiaſtical affairs? Tis either the <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſane</hi> or <hi>None.</hi> But if the Dioceſane as ſuch receives his Commiſſion from Jeſus Chriſt, even as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did, then they are <hi>Gods</hi> Officers, and not the <hi>Kings.</hi> And if ſo, ſeeing the <hi>King</hi> doth nothing but by his Officers, that is, by ſuch as act by a Commiſſion received from him, the King hath in this reſpect loſt at leaſt the Ezerciſe of his Prerogative. But if they are the Kings Officers, and depend as much on the King as the Civil, then their Dioceſan Epiſcopacy is not of Divine, 'tis but of Humane Right.</p>
            <p>We acknowledge that 'tis the ſenſe of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> that Princes are Ordain'd of God to Govern Eccleſiaſtical, as well as other Perſons: and that therefore, if we conſider ſuch as are appointed by the King to govern under him <hi>Circa Sacra,</hi> as the Officers of God
<pb facs="tcp:61768:7"/>
               <hi>Fundamentally,</hi> and not <hi>Formally,</hi> it may be granted. But when we ſpeak of the <hi>Officers of Chriſt</hi> in Contradiſtinction to the <hi>Officers of the King,</hi> we mean ſuch, whoſe Authority is from God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains good, though the Prince ſhould oppoſe it, as in the caſe of the Primitive Officers of Divine Inſtitution, who being forbidden to Preach in Chriſts name, could reply, <hi>Whether we ſhall obey God or Man Judge ye.</hi> The Office of a Presbyter, or Congregational Biſhop is ſo much of God, that what right ſoever the Magiſtrate may have concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nomination, Election, or Preſentation, or Appointing of any ſuch Eccleſiaſtical Miniſters, his Prohibition cannot make void that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion he hath received from Jeſus Chriſt. But ſuch as are <hi>Officers of the King,</hi> whether about the <hi>matters of the Lord,</hi> or about the <hi>King (i. e.)</hi> whether <hi>Circa ſacra,</hi> or about <hi>Civil</hi> Affairs, 'tis in the Power of the Supream Magiſtrate to give or take his Commiſſion, as it pleaſeth him, yea to direct to the Number of ſuch Officers, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them their peculiar work, and to alter and change as the neceſſity of Affairs, and State of the National Conſtitution ſhall require.</p>
            <p>There muſt be a regard had unto the preſent temper, and ſtate of the Kingdom, in which the Church is, and a ſuiting the Eccleſiaſtical Affairs ſo far as they may have an influence on the State after ſuch a manner, as is moſt conducive to the more firm eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Fundamental</hi> Conſtitution, and conſequently Peace of the State, to which end the Civil Magiſtrate muſt ſtill firmly adhere to that known <hi>Rule</hi> by which King <hi>Henry</hi> profeſſed to walk, which is expreſſed in the neceſſary Erudition, <hi>viz. The Scripture doth teach, That all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian People,</hi> as <hi>well as Prieſts and Biſhops,</hi> as <hi>all other ſhould be obedient unto Princes,</hi> and <hi>Poteſtates of the World; For the Truth is, that God Conſtituted</hi> and <hi>Ordained the Authority of Chriſtian Kings and Princes to be the moſt High, and Supream above all other Powers, and Officers in this World, in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Government of their People, and committed to them as unto the chief leads of their Commonwealths, the Cure and Overſight of all the People which be in their Realms, and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</hi> without any exception: <hi>and to them of</hi> Right, <hi>and by</hi> Gods Commandment, <hi>belongeth not only to prohibit Unlawfull Violence,</hi> to <hi>correct Offenders</hi> by <hi>Corporal Death,</hi> or <hi>other puniſhment,</hi> to <hi>Cenſure Moral Honeſty among their Subjects, according to the Laws of their Realms,</hi> to <hi>defend Juſtice, and to procure the Publick Weal,</hi> and <hi>Common Peace</hi> and <hi>Tranquility in Outward</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:61768:8"/>and <hi>Earthly things: But</hi> Eſpecially <hi>and</hi> Principally, <hi>to Defend the Faith of Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Religion,</hi> to <hi>conſerve and maintain the true Doctrine of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>all ſuch as be true Preachers and Setters forth thereof,</hi> and <hi>to aboliſh all Abuſes, Hereſies and Idolatries,</hi> and to <hi>puniſh with Corporal Pain, ſuch as of malice be the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſame.</hi> And Finally, <hi>to Overſee,</hi> and <hi>cauſe that the ſaid Biſhops and Prieſts,</hi> do <hi>execute their Paſtoral Office truly and faithfully,</hi> and <hi>eſpecially in thoſe points, which by Chriſt and his Apoſtles were given and committed unto them;</hi> and <hi>in caſe they ſhall be negligent in any part thereof, or would not dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently execute the ſame,</hi> to <hi>cauſe them to redouble and ſupply their lack. And if they obſtinately withſtand their Princes kind monition, and will not mend their Faults: then and in ſuch caſe to put others in their rooms and places. And God hath alſo commanded the ſaid Biſhops and Prieſts to obey with all humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Reverence both Kings, and Princes, and Governours, and all their Laws, not</hi> being contrary to the Laws of God, <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they be,</hi> and that <hi>not only</hi> propter iram, <hi>but alſo</hi> propter Conſcientiam, that is to ſay, <hi>not only for fear of puniſhment,</hi> but <hi>alſo for diſcharge of Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Power of the Magiſtrate over all Perſons, to wit, <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical</hi> and <hi>Civil,</hi> is according to the Ordinance of God; and that 'tis a Part of the Magiſtrates Office to Defend the Faith of Chriſt, to maintain the true Doctrine and the Preachers thereof, and to Aboliſh all Abuſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the which muſt be done, not only by keeping to the Rule of the Goſpel, but in conjunction therewith, by taking a ſpecial care, that no unneceſſary thing be ſuffered, that in its Tendency is deſtructive of the Peace of the State. If the preſent conſtitution of the Government of the Church, as it is National, and of humane Right onely be in any Reſpects Inconſiſtent with the Publick Weal of the Kingdom, tis neceſſary, that it be alter'd; eſpecially when an Alteration in ſome little things, may abundantly contribute: unto the Laſting Peace, both of Church and State.</p>
            <p>But if the Church Government as <hi>Dioceſane</hi> or <hi>National</hi> be of Divine Right, there can be no Alteration of it, and conſequently, ſeeing the ſetting up any of the <hi>Kings Officers</hi> to Inſpect Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, is an Altering the Dioceſan Conſtitution, the <hi>Prince</hi> durſt not, though encouraged by an Act of Parliament, enter on it. What is of Divine Right is Sacred, and muſt not be touch'd, 'tis dangerous to come too
<pb facs="tcp:61768:8"/>near that Mount. For which Reaſon, how miſcheivous ſoever the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical-National-Government,</hi> may in Proceſs of time be unto the Civil; the Civil, not the Eccleſiaſtical muſt be Altered. That there may be an Adjuſting matters in debate between the <hi>Dioceſane,</hi> and the <hi>State,</hi> the <hi>State</hi> muſt ſubmit unto the Dioceſane. For the King according to this Hypotheſis hath nothing to do with Church Affairs, which are wholly by the word of God confined to Churchmen, among whoſe number the <hi>King</hi> cannot be juſtly mention'd, neither may the King take any Cognizance of what is done among them, nor may they hold their Courts in his, but only in their own Name, or rather in Jeſus Chriſts. A Notion ſo inconſiſtent with his Majeſties juſt <hi>Prerogative,</hi> and the Powers of Parliaments, that as it doth deſtroy the <hi>Former,</hi> in like manner it doth ſo very much limit the <hi>Latter,</hi> as to <hi>Alter</hi> the <hi>Fundamental</hi> Conſtitution of our Government.</p>
            <p>By this time I preſume it may appear with ſome Conviction to the <hi>Reader.</hi>

            <p>Theſe Aſſemblies once eſtabliſhed, as ſo many <hi>Compleat Particular Churches,</hi> whoſe <hi>Paſtors</hi> have full Power for the Adminiſtring all Ordinances, and the exerciſing Diſcipline over thoſe who do freely and of choice ſubmit thereunto, may notwithſtanding leſſer Differences, be conſidered as United unto one another, in that they Profeſs the ſame Faith, Preach the ſame Word, and Adminiſter the ſame Sacraments.
<pb facs="tcp:61768:9"/>For the Proof hereof conſult the <hi>Neceſſary Erudition,</hi> where tis ſaid, <q>That the Unity of the Holy Church of Christ is not divided by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Place, nor by <hi>Diverſity of Traditions</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies, diverſeſly obſerved in divers Churches,</hi> for good Order of the ſame: And though in Traditions, Opinions, and Policies, there was ſome Diverſity among them [<hi>(i.e.)</hi> the <hi>Churches of Corinth of Epheſe, &amp;c.</hi>] likewiſe as the Church of <hi>England, Spain, Italy, Pole,</hi> be not ſeparate from the Unity, but be one Church in God, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that among them, there is great diſtance of Place, <hi>Diverſity</hi> of <hi>Traditions,</hi> not in all things Unity of Opinions, <hi>Alteration in Rites, Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> or Eſtimation of the ſame—<hi>ſuch Diverſity in Opinions,</hi> and <hi>other outward Manners and Cuſtomes</hi> of Policy, doth <hi>not diſſolve and break the Unity</hi> which is in <hi>One God, One Faith, One Doctrine of Chriſt and his Sacraments</hi> preſerv'd and kept in theſe <hi>ſeveral Churches</hi> without any Superiority or Preheminence, that one Church by Gods Law may, or ought to Challenge over another.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus Particular Parochial, or Congregational Churches may be United in One God, One Faith, One Doctrine of Chriſt and his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, even where there is ſome difference between them in leſſer matters. What though in one Pariſh there is a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> in another a <hi>Directory,</hi> ſhall this hinder Union? Don't even the Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves acknowledge, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> was very cloſely United, even among themſelves, notwithſtanding the ſeveral diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>Offices</hi> there were in uſe among us in the times of Popery? One <hi>Office</hi> after the uſe of <hi>Sarum,</hi> another after the uſe of <hi>York,</hi> of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor, &amp;c.</hi> and yet all United. Moreover what more common than to obſerve many little differences in <hi>Civil Corporations,</hi> even where they are all United in one head. A conſideration ſufficient to evince the Union of Parochial Churches to be Poſſible, notwithstanding ſome Remaining Differences in Customs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In theſe Kingdoms there are a multitude of <hi>Particular Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and <hi>little Policies,</hi> whoſe Customs and modes of Government within themſelves, are very Different. The particular Laws by which they are govern'd as a Particular Body Corporate are of as many different kinds as there are Cities, Towns, or Pariſhes; but yet <hi>All United,</hi> in that they ſwear Alleigance to his Majeſty, and ſubmit themſelves to the General Laws of the Land. The different Cuſtoms of different places do not in the leaſt break the Union of the Nation.
<pb facs="tcp:61768:9"/>And why may it not be ſo in the <hi>Church?</hi> What Reaſon can there be given, why the Union of many a Civil Society or Aſſociation may be, notwithſtanding the different Customes are among them, but the Union of many Particular-Parochial-Churches cannot be, unleſs they all agree in every little thing.</p>
            <p>Methinks it is as Reaſonable to plead for a destroying the <hi>Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Cuſtomes,</hi> and <hi>Charters</hi> of <hi>Burroughs,</hi> Corporations, and Cities as the only way to Union in the Civil Government, as 'tis to aſſert, That nothing but an Uniformity among every Parochial or Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church can Unite us in the Eccleſiastical. What though there are ſome differences among Parochial Churches as to their Cuſtomes and modes of Worſhip, ſo long as they agree in <hi>One Faith, One Lord, One Baptiſm:</hi> So long as they all Profeſs the ſame Faith, Preach the ſame Word, Administer the ſame Sacraments, and ſubmit unto the ſame <hi>Civil Government:</hi> So long as they all Swear Allegiance to to their Prince, and Subſcribe any Teſt to aſſure the World they are ſound Protestants, the which being ſo, what hinders a firm and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Union?</p>
            <p>Certainly, This is enough to ſhew, that their Union, if no more, is as much as that between One City and another, One Corporation and another, and that their differences are no greater, (if ſo great) than thoſe between one City and another. The which being ſo, An Alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Preſent Laws about Conformity, and an Establiſhing ſuch New ones, as ſhall be Judged neceſſary by our Governours for the defence and ſafety of a Parochial or Congregational Church-Diſcipline, as well as for the Regulating his Majesties Officers <hi>Circa Sacra,</hi> will Unite us, and put an end to that Horrid ſin of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> that hath theſe many years abounded in the midst of us. Let the Diſſenters be permitted to Embrace the Laws and Customes of their Fore-fathers in the Apoſtles days about Church-Diſcipline, and the Mode of Worſhip, and they are Relieved, the which may be done without any Injury to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of any ſound Proteſtant of the Epiſcopal Perſwaſion. I ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> This cannot but ſatisfie any moderate <hi>Epiſcoparian,</hi> who may, if he pleaſe, firmly abide by thoſe Ceremonies he now doth. He may ſtill Read the ſame Prayers among ſuch as are of his own Opinion. He may wear the ſame Vestments, and addreſs himſelf to his Majeſties Officer the Lord Biſhop, as unto his <hi>Ordinary</hi> for Councel and Advice. And if his Ordinary or Dioceſan be an <hi>Elder</hi> (for that is left to the Supream Magistrate to appoint) he may look on him [though in truth as <hi>ſuch,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:61768:10"/>he being only the Kings Officer <hi>Circa Sacra</hi>] as a Biſhop who is of an <hi>Order Superiour</hi> to that of a Presbyter, and ſo exerciſe Diſciplene as he Receives Encouragement from him.</p>
            <p>If there be any entring on the Miniſtry, who think a <hi>Dioceſane Epiſcopacy</hi> to be <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> and is called unto a <hi>Pariſh</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi> of the ſame Judgment. This <hi>Candidate</hi> may (if the Kings Officer be an Elder, and of the ſame mind with him) apply himſelf unto him, as unto his <hi>Dioceſane,</hi> and receive <hi>Orders</hi> from him, and do all things as now, unleſs our Governours Judge meet to make any Alteration as to the uſe of ſome Ceremonies, Only let none be by Law compelled to do ſo.</p>
            <p>Let thoſe that are ſo <hi>weak,</hi> as to think a <hi>Dioceſane Epiſcopacy</hi> to be of Divine Right enjoy the Liberty of their Conſciences, the which being attended but with the vouchſafing the like Liberty unto others, I know not why they may not be ſatisfied. We are not for the Pulling down Lord Biſhops, nor for an Alienating Church Lands. If it ſeem good to our Governours to continue them, we only deſire, that the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of their <hi>Office</hi> be declared to be no other than what it was <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently</hi> in this Kingdom, which is, <hi>That they are meerly the Kings Creatures, That all they do muſt be in the Kings Name, and by vertue of a Commiſſion receiv'd from him: That as</hi> ſuch <hi>they are only the Kings Magiſtrates, that act</hi> Circa Sacra, <hi>That their work is</hi> only to ſee that <hi>the Biſhops</hi> or <hi>Presbyters</hi> within <hi>their allotted Precincts</hi> diſcharge their Duty not only in leading Godly Lives, but in Preaching the word, adminiſtring the Sacraments, and exerciſing Diſcipline according to the Rule of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>We are far from pulling down ſuch Biſhops, for we rather wiſh that whereas there is now one, there might be five, nor are we for the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enating Church Land any more than we are for the taking from his <hi>Majeſties</hi> other <hi>Civil Officers,</hi> thoſe <hi>Penſions</hi> are allowed them for their great ſervices. A thing we eſteem as neceſſary, and highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient as what doth not only conduce very much to the Encouragement of all ſorts of <hi>Learning:</hi> the <hi>equal</hi> Administration of Juſtice, but as what advanceth the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Grandeur</hi> of the State. But,</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> This doth no way <hi>Embaſe his Majeſties Prerogative</hi> in matters Eccleſiastical, It doth rather make it the more <hi>Grand</hi> and <hi>Auguſt.</hi> His Majesty is hereby acknowledged to be the <hi>Supream Head</hi> of the Church. All Officers <hi>Circa Sacra</hi> depend as much on his Majeſties Pleaſure for their Places as any other Civil Officers. 'Tis in the Kings
<pb facs="tcp:61768:10"/>Name they must act, by vertue of a Commiſſion received from him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the <hi>King</hi> is Recognized as the ſole Governour of the Kingdom, and hath no Competitors with him, nor is he in danger of Forreign Uſurpations.</p>
            <p>To ſumme up all, Let <hi>all ſuch Particular Congregational,</hi> or <hi>Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Churches,</hi> that are of Divine Inſtitution according to the ſenſe of the Old, and most true Church of <hi>England,</hi> be by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Patliament</hi> declar'd to be ſo, and taken under the Protection of the Laws, and the Diſſenters are ſatisfied: The which (as hath been prov'd) may be done without any wrong to the conſciences of the Conformiſt.</p>
            <p>This is the utmost I ſhall propoſe leaving it to the Wiſdom of the Nation to Regulate, and Order the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> ſo far as it is National and of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Make, as they Judge most Expedient. The <hi>States-men</hi> know beſt, how to alter, correct, or amend any thing in the preſent Frame, for which reaſon, Modeſty doth best become Divines, whonever ſucceed in any under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takements beyond their Sphere. If no encroachments be made on what is of Divine Institution no wrong can be done us.</p>
            <p>I deſire the Dean, and his Substitute to conſider this <hi>Propoſal,</hi> which is but a Revival of what was on our first leaving <hi>Rome,</hi> strenuouſly aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as the <hi>Onely</hi> way to break all the Deſigns of the Papists about Church Diſcipline; From the corruptions of which did proceed all the Popes Tyranous Uſurpations. Certainly the Eſtabliſhing this Notion cannot but be of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary uſe, as it Erects a <hi>Partition</hi> Wall between the Reformation, and the Corruptions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as it is adjuſted for the ſilencing all Differences among our ſelves, the healing our Breaches, and the fixing a firm and lasting Union among all ſound Protestants, whether <hi>Epiſcopal, Presbyterian, Congregational,</hi> or <hi>meer Anabaptiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I humbly apprehend this to be enough to evince, That the Diſſenters are not ſuch Enemies to Union as ſome have Aſſerted, nor are they for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying a <hi>National Church Government.</hi> They are onely against Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable Innovations, even ſuch as tend to the Ruine of the Old Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant National Church, which as ſuch is but of Humane Inſtitution, and in all ages muſt be of ſuch a Peculiar Form, as is best ſuited to thoſe great Ends, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods Glory in the Flouriſhing of particular Parochial, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Churches and the Peace of the State.</p>
            <p>The Diſſenters do know, that as One Particular Church is not to depend on another, as to be <hi>Accountable</hi> thereunto, when at any time ſhe may abuſe her Power, yet <hi>All</hi> are accountable unto the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> of that Land in which they Live, and that ſuch is the ſtate of things with us, that what perſon ſoever is griev'd, either by a Presbyter or Biſhop, or by any <hi>Inferiour Officer Circa Sacra,</hi> he may make his <hi>Appeal</hi> to the Supream Magiſtrate,
<pb facs="tcp:61768:11"/>with whom all Appeals on Earth are <hi>finally Lodg'd.</hi> Whatever the <hi>Deans Subſtitute</hi> may aſſert, 'tis most undoubtedly true, that <hi>no Appeal</hi> can be <hi>juſtly made from our King</hi> unto <hi>the Pope,</hi> or <hi>any Colledge of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Biſhops whatſoever.</hi> That herein as our <hi>Author</hi> diſſents from the <hi>Church of England,</hi> we do heartily agree with <hi>her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the ſound Proteſtant Party among the Sons of the Church of <hi>England</hi> do accord with the Diſſenters about this great Point, is not only evident from what a Conformiſt hath written in the following Treatiſe, but from what is aſſerted by the Judicious <hi>Dr. Burnet</hi> in the <hi>Hiſtory of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi> The which I do the more chearfully inſist on, that the world may ſee, How the Diſſenters have been miſrepreſented, and How clear they are from any Seditious or Factious Principles concerning Church Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>In Dr. <hi>Burnets Preface to the Hiſtory of the Reformation, p. 1.</hi> for which the whole Kingdom have given the Dr. thanks: 'tis aſſerted, <hi>That in</hi> Henry <hi>the 8ths time, 'twas an Eſtabliſh'd Principle, That every Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church is a compleat Body within it ſelf, ſo that the Church of</hi> England <hi>with the Authority and Concurrence of their Head and King, might examine or Reform all Errors or Corruptions, whether in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or Worſhip.</hi> Moreover in the Preamble of that Act by which this Principle was fix'd, 'tis declared, <hi>That the</hi> Crown of England <hi>was</hi> Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, <hi>and that the Nation was a Compleat Body within it ſelf, with a full Power to give Juſtice in all Caſes,</hi> Spiritual, <hi>as well as</hi> Temporal. <hi>And that in the</hi> Spiritualty, <hi>as there had been at all times, ſo there were then men of that Sufficiency and Integrity, that they might Declare and Determine all Doubts within the Kingdom, And that ſeveral Kings as</hi> Ed. <hi>1.</hi> Edw. <hi>3. Ric. 2. and</hi> Hen. <hi>4. had by ſeveral Laws Preſerv'd the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the Realm both</hi> Spiritual and Temporal <hi>from the Annoyance of the See of</hi> Rome, <hi>and other</hi> Forreign Potentates, <hi>Hiſt. Ref. p. 1. p. 127.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, the ſame <hi>Judicious Author,</hi> by an <hi>Extract</hi> out of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Erudition,</hi> and out of the <hi>Kings Book de Differentia Regiae &amp; Eccleſiaſticae Poteſtatis,</hi> out of <hi>Gardiners de vera Obedientia,</hi> and <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Prefix'd Epiſtle,</hi> and out of a Letter written by <hi>Stokesly</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Tonſtall</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Dureſm,</hi> hath made it evident that the Church in <hi>Henry 8.</hi> did not only aſſert the Kings <hi>Supremacy,</hi> but as a Truth in Conjunction therewith, held, <hi>That in the Primitive Church, the Biſhops in their Councels made Rules for Ordering their Dioceſſes which they only called CANONS or RULES, nor had they any</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive Authority, <hi>but what was deriv'd from the Civil Sanction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſufficient evincement that they did not believe <hi>General Councils</hi> to be by Jeſus Christ made the <hi>Regent part</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> neither
<pb facs="tcp:61768:11"/>did they believe their Determinations, or Decrees, to lay any Obligation on the Conſcience, unleſs Sanction'd by the Magiſtrates command.</p>
            <p>To this Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> ſpeaks excellently well in his <hi>Preface to the Second Part of the Hiſt. Refor.</hi> 
               <q>The <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> of <hi>Synods</hi> or <hi>Councils</hi> is founded either on the Rules of Expediency or Brotherly Correſpondence, or on the force of Civil Laws; For when the Christian Belief had not the ſupport of Law, Every Biſhop taught his own Flock the best he could, and gave his Neighbours ſuch an account of his Faith at, or ſoon after his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, as ſatisfied them, and ſo maintain'd the <hi>Unity</hi> of the Church. The <hi>Formality of Synods</hi> grew up in the Church from the Diviſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and the Dignity of the ſeveral Cities, which is a thing ſo well known, and ſo plainly acknowledged by the Writers of all ſides, that it were a needleſs Impoſing on the Readers Patience to ſpend time to prove it. Such as would underſtand it more perfectly, will find it in <hi>de Marca,</hi> the late <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi>'s Books <hi>de Concordia Imperii &amp; Sacerdotii,</hi> and in <hi>Blondels</hi> works <hi>de La Primaute de l'Engliſe,</hi> None can Imagine there is a Divine Authority in that, which ſprang from ſuch a Beginning. The <hi>Major</hi> part of <hi>Synods</hi> cannot be ſuppoſed to be in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, ſo aſſiſted from Heaven, that the leſſer part muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Acquieſce in their Decrees, or that the <hi>Civil powers</hi> must always <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure their Laws</hi> by their Votes, eſpecially where intrest doth viſibly turn the Scales, ſo far Dr. <hi>Burnet.</hi>
               </q> The contrary unto which being aſſerted by the <hi>Deans Subſtitute,</hi> 'tis Apparent, that he doth abundantly recede from the true <hi>Church of England,</hi> not only to the Reproach of his Profeſſion, but of the firſt Reformation, and grief of the ſober and moderate Conformist.</p>
            <p>This I thought neceſſary to ſuggeſt, that I might engage the <hi>Reader</hi> to conſider with what Injuſtice this Author treats, not only thoſe who diſſent from the Church in ſome things, but the Sober Conformiſt alſo, who is a through Church man, by Reprſenting us all as Enemies both to Church and State, as if the adhereing unto Old Protestant Principles about Church Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline had been the Overt Act of a Spirit Seditious and Phanatical.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſo fully ſhewn, How eaſy tis to put an end to the miſchevous Diviſions, which have, for ſome years paſt, prov'd very dangerous to this Kingdome. I will not inlarge on every little thing that our Authour may think deſerves our Animadverſions.</p>
            <p>The Rude, and ſlovenly methods he hath taken to aſperſe his Adverſaries are ſuch as do rather evince the Feebleneſs of his cauſe, than deſerve the the Regard of any ſober Perſon.</p>
            <p>His talk about the Impoſſibility of Union between the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Diſſenter, becauſe of the many Important Differences there are among
<pb facs="tcp:61768:12"/>our ſelves, is confuted by the Preſent Union of the Authours of the Enſuing Treatices, who, though they differ in little things as much as any, the One being a Confor. the other a Nonconformiſt; the third of a Uniting Spirit in the middle between us both, yet are we all heartily agreed in the things that would Unite us. Moreover it were eaſy to make it appear that the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces among the Diſſenters in General about Worſhip and Diſcipline are rather <hi>Nominal</hi> than <hi>Real,</hi> and that their Union is in a manner already accompliſh'd.</p>
            <p>The Notions we inſiſt on in oppoſing the Deans Subſtitute are truly Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, ſuch as are owned and embraced by the Famous <hi>Hooker,</hi> Dr. <hi>Feild.</hi> Mr. <hi>Chilliggworth</hi> and Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> and after a Signal manner by the Country Conformiſt, who hath expreſt himſelf in theſe Sheets with Gravity and Candor. He is aware of the deſign of this Author as well as we, as its Tendencie is towards <hi>Rome,</hi> and is ſenſible, that the methods taken in the oppoſition ſome of the Clergy make againſt the Peaceable Diſſenter, do Juſtifie the French in their Rigorous and moſt cruel Perſecutions.</p>
            <p>There is to the letter of Mr. <hi>Humfrey</hi> to me at the end, his late <hi>Paper</hi> added Entitled <hi>Materials for Union,</hi> which together with this Preface if we offer'd no more will prove the things I have ſaid to be Feaſible, and alone ſerve to that Firm and Laſting Union, which is chiefly aim'd at in theſe our joint endeavours.</p>
            <p>To conclude, The peace of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Greatneſs of the King who is head of it, being things moſt deſireable to every good Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and true Subject, we have in theſe Papers ſhewn our good will to doe ſomething towards the advance thereof: Which being ſubmitted to the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour thoughts of ſome one who is in a higher Sphere of Ability for the culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it, and of place for the repreſenting it without prejudice to our Sovereign, we do hope it may both be well accepted by him, and take with every body elſe, who do <hi>truly</hi> honour the King, ſeek Concord, and love good men.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61768:13"/>The Doctor's Subſtitute (as hereafter I will from his own words prove) doth ſufficiently declare what his party would be at, which is a point, I'm ſure, that will meet with oppoſition from ſuch as are true Sons of the Church, whereby the <hi>Controverſie,</hi> if cloſely followed, muſt ceaſe to be between <hi>Conformiſt</hi> and <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cormiſt;</hi> it muſt be between <hi>Conformiſt</hi> and <hi>Conformiſt.</hi> It looks as if there were among our Church-men ſome reſolv'd to revive <hi>Laud</hi>'s Deſign, as 'tis well known there are many others among them who highly value the <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Temper</hi> of that great Proteſtant Prelate <hi>Abbot, Laud</hi>'s Predeceſſor in the See of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> between whom the Scuſſle muſt at laſt end.</p>
                  <p>That this may with the greater Conviction be evinc'd, I will in this Reply to the Defence of the Dean, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> confine my ſelf to the Author's own words, as compared with what is more than ſuggeſted in the Writings of Biſhop <hi>Bramhall,</hi> and ſome other Sons of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> the which with due clearneſs I ſhall not be able to compaſs, if I follow our Author in his <hi>diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly</hi> way of Writing. For which reaſon I muſt keep to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod I took in the <hi>Modeſt and Peaceable Enquiry,</hi> and bring what calls for my obſervation, into its proper place. The whole then he hath offered in Anſwer to the <hi>Enquiry,</hi> may be reduced to theſe Heads.</p>

                  <p>The Author reflects on the <hi>Title,</hi> as if the Diſcourſe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſpecious pretences of the <hi>Title,</hi> had not been as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt,</hi> nor as <hi>Peaceable</hi> as ſuggeſted; in doing which, he ſpends one whole Chapter, it may be not f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>I could very eaſily therefore, as one unconcern'd, paſs by <hi>this firſt Chapter,</hi> if there had not been more in it than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting me as a perſon who deſerve not the Character of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either <hi>Modeſt</hi> or <hi>Peaceable.</hi> But the Overt acts of Immodeſty, which are inſiſted on by this Author, being ſuch as cannot but be of an <hi>ill Tendency,</hi> I muſt conſider 'em.</p>

                  <p>The firſt inſtance of Immodeſty is thus expreſs'd, <q>He begins his Epiſtle to the Dean, with obſerving how induſtrious the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts have been, ever ſince the Reformation, to ruine <hi>England</hi> and the Churches of Chriſt in it, which he ſufficiently proves from their <hi>Rebellions</hi> and <hi>Inſurrections</hi> in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s days, the <hi>Spaniſh Armado</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeths,</hi> the <hi>Gun-Powder Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> in King <hi>James</hi>'s, &amp;c. and the late <hi>Helliſh Conſpiracy,</hi> which was deſigned for the utter Extirpation of the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the univerſal Deſtruction of all the Profeſſors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whether Epiſcopal or Diſſenter. <hi>But this modeſt man</hi> (ſaies our Author) <hi>takes no notice, That King and Kingdom, Church and State have been once ruined already by ſuch</hi> Modeſt Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>and may be in a fair way for it again, if we ſuffer our ſelves to be</hi> Charmed and Lulled aſleep <hi>by ſuch modeſt Inquirers:</hi> We are aware, Sir, what a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Zeal <hi>would</hi> do, and what a <hi>Factious</hi> Zeal <hi>has</hi> done; and think our ſelves concern'd, <hi>as much as we can, to countermine the Deſigns of both.</hi> But however, I confeſs it was very modeſtly done to paſs over this, that while men are zealous againſt Popery, they may fear no danger from any other quarter.</q>

For 'tis well known to many hundreds now alive, who they were that had an Influence on thoſe Unnatural Broils and Inteſtine Quarrels; and whoever will conſult Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> againſt <hi>Hinekley,</hi> or rather Mr. <hi>Ruſhworth,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> will ſee, <hi>That the Sons of the Church of</hi> England <hi>more on both ſides the active perſons concern'd in the very beginning of thoſe Troubles.</hi> But thoſe things the <hi>Inquirer</hi> was loath to mention, it being as Unneceſſary, as Unſuitable to his <hi>Peaceable</hi> Deſign.</p>

And ſo far both the <hi>King</hi> and he had very good reaſon to be ſenſible of the Dangers which were threatned to them. But when the large Diſcovery was brought unto him, tranſmitted in <hi>Boſwell</hi>'s Letter of the 15th of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> he found ſome <hi>Names</hi> in it, which diſcredited the whole Relation, as well in his <hi>Majeſties</hi> judgment, as his own. For, beſides this naming of ſome profeſt <hi>Papists,</hi> as the Dutcheſs of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the Counteſſes of <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Newport, Montague, Digby</hi> and <hi>Winter,</hi> of whoſe Fidelity the King was not willing to have any <hi>Suſpicion,</hi> he named the Earl of <hi>Arundel, Winde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank</hi> Principal Secretary of State, and <hi>Porter</hi> one of the Grooms of the Bed-chamber, whom he charged to be the King's utter Enemies, and ſuch as betrayed his Secrets to the Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi> upon all occaſions; all which his <hi>Majeſty</hi> beheld as men of moſt approved <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> to him, by reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of no <hi>further credit being given to the Advertiſement</hi> which they had from <hi>Boſwell,</hi> the danger, <hi>ſo much feared at firſt, became more ſlighted and neglected, than conſiſted with his Majeſties Safety,</hi> and the condition of the times, which were apt to miſchief. For, though the Party, who firſt brake the Ice to this Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, might be miſtaken in the <hi>Names</hi> of ſome of the <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices,</hi> which were intereſſed in the Deſign, whoſe relations unto thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> might give ſome ground for the miſtake; yet the <hi>Calamities,</hi> which ſoon after fell upon them both, the <hi>deplorable Death</hi> of the Archbiſhop firſt, and his <hi>Majesty</hi> afterwards, declare ſufficiently, <hi>That there was ſome greater reality in the Plot, than ſome were willing to believe.</hi> But it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61768:15"/>it had been a <hi>Maxime</hi> with King <hi>James,</hi> his Father, That <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion was the Sickneſs and Diſeaſe of a Tyrant,</hi> which laid him open to all the ſubtle practices of malicious cunning. And it had been taken up by this <hi>King</hi> for an <hi>Axiom</hi> alſo, <hi>That it was better to be Deceived than to Distrust; which paved a plain and eaſie way to all thoſe Misfortunes, which in the whole courſe of his Reign, eſpecially for ten years last past, had been brought upon him.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>By this 'tis evident, That the <hi>Papists</hi> were the <hi>first Contrivers</hi> of all that ruine which befel the King and Kingdom, Church and State; and that the <hi>first</hi> who received any impreſſions from their wretched Attempts, were the <hi>Sons of the Church,</hi> is as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to ſuch as conſult <hi>Baxter, Ruſhworth,</hi> &amp;c. who it may be were ignorant of their Helliſh Deſigns; though 'tis evident e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that <hi>Laud</hi> was acquainted with them: For which reaſon it ſeems ſomewhat ſurprizing, that notwithſtanding his being ſo fully enlightned concerning it, he ſtill inclin'd to favour the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist</hi> more than the <hi>Puritan;</hi> concerning which party, they had nothing but their ungrounded Surmiſes to occaſion any ill thoughts of 'em. For in the whole account <hi>Heylin</hi> gives of <hi>their Eſſays,</hi> I find nothing but intimations of their <hi>Secret</hi> actings, which 'tis like were ſo ſecret, that not one Overt Act can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before there was an open breach between <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> at which time the <hi>Papists</hi> come in as <hi>Auxiliaries</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Puritan</hi> Party came in as ſuch to the <hi>Parliament:</hi> the King remaining to the very Death a Reſolved <hi>Protestant,</hi> which animated the <hi>Papist</hi> to do their utmoſt for his Ruine; in which after they had in part accompliſhed their <hi>Deviliſh Deſign,</hi> they ſtrangely triumph'd. I queſtion not but that many of the <hi>Roman</hi> Faction were in both Armies, in the one <hi>Openly,</hi> in the other under a <hi>Covert;</hi> and that they attempted to heighten the Diviſion; and at length turn'd all things into Confuſion. This I take to be a true account of the Tranſaction; but why our <hi>Churchmen</hi> ſhould thus glory, as if they had no hand in it, is not eaſie to conjecture: Neither is it over-eaſie to imagine, what the reaſon is, that our Author ſhould repreſent the <hi>Papist</hi> ſo favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, even when his Diſcourſe againſt the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> is ſo <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective.</hi> For ſaith he,</p>

                  <p>Is it not moſt obvious, that notwithſtanding the loud Cries we have had of the <hi>Factious and Seditious Principles of Diſſenters,</hi> the Diſſenters have approved themſelves, when under the ſevereſt Cenſures and Preſſures of our <hi>Clergy,</hi> to be men of another Character?

                  <p>Methinks, Sir, 'tis now high time to conſider, That <hi>as</hi> all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, whether <hi>Epiſcopal, Presbyterian,</hi> or <hi>Congregational,</hi> &amp;c. are all in one bottom, even <hi>ſo</hi> the One cannot be ruin'd with the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Other.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> How is this that our Author treats the <hi>Dean</hi> ſo unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly, as to joyn him thus with the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Coleman!</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks a deſending the <hi>Dean</hi> ſhould be a diſtinct work from a <hi>vindicating</hi> the reputation of <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and the Traitor <hi>Coleman.</hi> And why, Sir, may I not laugh at the Counſels of ſome <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> without being immodeſt to the Doctor?

Really Sir, if by Reviling Diſſenters I meant a Confuting of them, I fear I ſhould have wronged the Doctor and the Truth alſo, if I had but ſaid there was any one Reviling paſſage in the whole Treatiſe; but the fixing this ſenſe on the words, to the end you may give us an account of your <hi>admirable Faculty</hi> of Talking very little to the purpoſe, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency wherein you ſeem to delight; for I'm ſure you are ſo modeſt as to faſten your own, which is a foreign ſenſe on my words, and then run on triumphantly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but after ſo eaſie a

                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> That I might prevent any juſt offence here, I was expreſs in diſtinguiſhing between the <hi>Deans</hi> own intent, and tendency of his <hi>Treatiſe.</hi> Take my words in the <hi>Enquiry,</hi> 
                     <q>I will propoſe the Deſign of the Dr's <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> [<hi>(i. e.)</hi> of that account he had given of Diſſenters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] being charitably diſpos'd to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Finis Operis,</hi> and <hi>Operantis;</hi>
                     </q> For though the <hi>End</hi> of the work it ſelf cannot but in its tendency prove pernicious to the Proteſtant Religion, yet <hi>I hope the Dr. deſign'd it not as ſuch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But though I thought my ſelf oblig'd to be thus civil in my thoughts of the <hi>Reverend Dean,</hi> I do not find any Reaſon to paſs the ſame favourable Cenſure on you. The Dr. I knew wrote againſt the <hi>Papists;</hi> but whether you have not in ſome <hi>Treatiſes</hi> formerly done as much in ſome reſpects for 'em, is beſt known to your ſelf. Whatever you have done either for or againſt the <hi>Papist</hi> formerly, by what I find in your <hi>Defence</hi> of the Dean, I do very much ſuſpect you. 'Tis very evident, you have in your <hi>Notions</hi> about the <hi>Nature</hi> of an <hi>Univerſal Church,</hi> the <hi>Notion of Schiſm,</hi> &amp;c. faln in with thoſe that were not aſhamed to own, that they were for a going towards <hi>Rome,</hi> in order to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating the Differences between the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Papiſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this may appear to be ſo, I will faithfully ſet down your notion of theſe things, and then compare it with the Deſign of Archb. <hi>Laud</hi> and Archb. <hi>Bramhall,</hi> and leave it to the judgment of the Candid and Impartial Reader, whether you are not of thoſe who ran the <hi>Caſſandrian way.</hi> You ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">§ 1. That the <hi>Catholique Church</hi> conſiſts of ſuch Particular Churches, as have all the Eſſentials of <hi>a</hi> Church, as to Faith, Government, and Diſcipline. It conſiſts of all theſe, as Similar parts, which have the ſame Nature, and make up one Body by a common Union. This <hi>p.</hi> 139, 140.</p>
                  <p n="2">§ 2. That the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> though it conſiſts of all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches contained in it, yet 'tis not a meer arbitrary combination and confederacy of particular Churches; but is

                  </p>
                  <p>Here you aſſert, That <hi>the Univerſal Church is in order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture antecedent to Particular Churches, as the Sun is before its Beams, and the Root before its Branches,</hi> &amp;c. But your Alluſion is not <hi>ad rem;</hi> for you ſhould have given us ſome inſtance of ſome one Univerſal, that was in order of nature antecedent to its Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, which is impoſſible; it being, in the ſenſe of moſt, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, That <hi>Univerſale</hi> is <hi>unum in multis,</hi> that is, <hi>in many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,</hi> which Univerſal hath no real Exiſtence, but in Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; for abſtracted from all Particulars, 'tis only an <hi>Ens ratic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> having its being in the <hi>Eutopian Commonwealth;</hi> whence we diſtinguiſh between the conſideration of an <hi>Univerſal</hi> as <hi>Formal, and as <hi>Fundamental.

Now if it be the Particulars that are the foundation of the Univerſal, How can the Univerſal be the Root of the Particulars? This is the more remarkable in our Author, becauſe he falls in with an old exploded part of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency,</hi> viz. <hi>That what perſon ſoever is not a Member of a Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, is not ſo of the Univerſal Church.</hi> Which being ſo, I would fain know Where this Univerſal Church ſhould be, when Antecedent to any Particular Church?

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That not every ſeparation,</hi> but <hi>a cauſleſs ſeparation from the</hi> external communion <hi>of any Church, is the ſin of</hi> Schiſm.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That impoſing upon men under pain of Excommunication, a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of profeſſing known errors, and practiſing known corruptions, is a ſufficient and neceſſary cauſe of ſeparation; and that this is the cauſe which Proteſtants alledg to juſtifie their ſeparation from the Church of Rome.</hi> To which I muſt add, That this is the cauſe which Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters alledg to juſtifie their ſeparation from the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> it being uncontroulably true, That the profeſſing known errors, and the practiſing known corruptions, is impoſed on Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters on <hi>pain of Excommunication,</hi> as hath been proved in Mr. <hi>Baxter's firſt Plea for Peace,</hi> never anſwered, but only nibled at by ſome inconſiderate Scriblers. The Diſſenters are convinc'd in conſcience, that if they continued in your communion, they ſhould ſin againſt God. What can be offered againſt this, I know not, unleſs you'l ſay unto us thus, viz. <hi>If this your pretence of conſcience may ſerve, what Schiſmatick in the Church, what popular ſeditious brain in a Kingdom, may not alledg the dictamen of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to free themſelves from Schiſm or Sedition? No man wiſhes them to do any thing againſt their conſcience; but we ſay that they may and ought to rectifie and depoſe ſuch a conſcience, which is eaſie for them to do.</hi> This is what hath been frequently urg'd by the <hi>Clergy,</hi> yea by the Dean of <hi>Pauls.</hi> But ſeeing theſe words are taken out of the mouth of a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> the anſwer ſhall be no other than what I find in the mouth of a ſon of the Church, the famous <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth,</hi> who aſſerts, <hi>That whoever is convinced in conſcience, that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>errs, cannot with a good conſcience but forſake her in the profeſſion and practice of her errors; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hereof is manifeſt, becauſe otherwiſe he muſt profeſs what he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61768:20"/>not, and practice what he approves not; which is no more than your ſelf</hi> in theſi <hi>have divers times affirmed.</hi> For <hi>in one place</hi> you ſay, 'tis <hi>unlawful to ſpeak any the leaſt untruth.</hi> Now <hi>he that profeſſes your Religion, and believes it not, what elſe doth he but live in a perpetual lye?</hi> Again, in another, <hi>you have called them that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs one thing, and believe another, a</hi> damned crew of diſſembling Sycophants. And therefore in inveighing againſt Proteſtants for forſaking the profeſſion of thoſe Errors, the belief whereof they had already forſaken, what do you but rail at them for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a damned crew of Sycophants? [The ſame may be ſaid as to the Diſſenters who are in conſcience convinced, that they muſt profeſs to believe what really they do not, ſhould they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form]. But as to what the wicked may pretend as to conſcience, take the Author's anſwer: <hi>'Tis ſaid that a pretence of conſcience will not ſerve to juſtifie ſeparation from being Schiſmatical; which is true, but little to the purpoſe,</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Chil.</hi>) <hi>ſeeing it was but an erroneous perſuaſion, much leſs an</hi> hypocritical <hi>pretence, but a</hi> true and well grounded conviction of conſcience. <hi>And therefore though ſeditious men in the Church and State, may pretend</hi> conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for a cloak of their Rebellion; <hi>yet this I hope hinders not but that an honeſt man ought to obey his rightly informed conſcience, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the unjuſt command of his Tyrannous Superiors.

                  <p n="1">§ 1.

And 'tis obſervable, that the party to which they gave this Licence, was that, whoſe Doctrine, though it was not contrary to Law, was contrary to Cuſtom; and for a long time in this Kingdom was no oftner Preached,

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="2">2. Touching the <hi>Deſign of working a Reconciliation</hi> betwixt <hi>us</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> 'tis acknowledged by <hi>Heylin,</hi> and the Deſign ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded. Take his own words, <q>I thought when our Saviour ſaid <hi>Beati Pacifici,</hi> it had been ſufficient warrant to any man to endeavour Peace, to build up the Breaches in the <hi>Church,</hi> and to make <hi>Jeruſalem like a City, which is at Unity in it ſelf,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where it may be done not only <hi>Salvâ Charitate,</hi> without breach of Charity; but <hi>Salvâ Fide</hi> too, without wrong to Faith. The greateſt part of the Controverſies between us and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> not being in the <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> or in any <hi>Eſſential point</hi> in the Chriſtian Religion, I cannot but look upon it as a moſt pious work, to endeavour an <hi>Attonement</hi> in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructures.</q> So far <hi>Heylin</hi> goes to ſhew both the <hi>Lawfulneſs</hi> of the endeavours of a Reconciliation, and then the <hi>Poſſibility</hi>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:61768:21"/>of obtaining of it. The which Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> no ſooner evinces, but he admits that ſuch a <hi>Reconciliation</hi> was <hi>endeavoured</hi> betwixt the <hi>Agents</hi> for both Churches, and gives an hint upon what terms the Agreement was to have been made, and how far they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded on it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <q>As to Reconciliation (ſaith he out of a Book entituled the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Nuncio,</hi> affirmed to have been written by a <hi>Venetian</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, at his being in <hi>England</hi>) between the Churches of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> there were made ſome General Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Overtures by the <hi>Archbiſhops Agents;</hi> they aſſuring, that his <hi>Grace was very much diſpoſed thereunto:</hi> And that if it was not accompliſh'd in his Life-time, it would prove a work of more difficulty after his Death. That in very truth, for the laſt <hi>three years</hi> the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> had introduced ſome <hi>Innovations, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching near the Rites and Forms of</hi> Rome: That the Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> a great Confident of his Grace, the Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, and eight other Biſhops of his Grace's party, did moſt <hi>paſſionately</hi> deſire a <hi>Reconciliation</hi> with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> that they did day by day recede from their antient Tenents, to <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate with the Church of</hi> Rome; that therefore the <hi>Pope</hi> ought on his part to make ſome ſteps to <hi>meet</hi> them, and the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> remit ſomething of its Rigour in Doctrine, or otherwiſe no accord will be. The <hi>Compoſition</hi> on both ſides was in ſo good a forwardneſs before <hi>Panzany</hi> left the Kingdom, that the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> and <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Chicheſter</hi> had often ſaid, That there were but two ſorts of people likely to impede and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Reconciliation; to wit, the <hi>Puritans</hi> amongſt the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> amongſt the <hi>Catholiques.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Let us next ſee the judgment and relation of another Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, in a Gloſs or Comment on the former, entituled <hi>The</hi> Engliſh <hi>Pope,</hi> Printed at <hi>London</hi> in the ſame Year, 1643, and he will tell us, That after <hi>Con</hi> had undertook the managing of the Affairs, matters began to grow to ſome Agreement. The <hi>King</hi> Required, ſaith he, ſuch a Diſpenſation from the then Pope, as that his <hi>Catholique</hi> Subjects might reſort to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Churches, and to take the Oaths of Supremacy and Fidelity; and that the Pope's Juriſdiction here ſhould be declared to be but of <hi>Humane Right.</hi> And ſo far had the <hi>Pope</hi> conſented, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever did concern the King therein, ſhould have been really performed, ſo far as other <hi>Catholick Princes</hi> uſually enjoy and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61768:22"/>expect as their due: And ſo far as the Biſhops were to be <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent both from King and Pope,</hi> there was no fear of breach on the Pope's part. So that upon the point, the Pope was to content himſelf amongſt us in <hi>England</hi> with <hi>a Priority, inſtead of a Superiority</hi> over other Biſhops; and with <hi>a Primacy</hi> inſtead of <hi>a Supremacy</hi> in theſe Parts of Chriſtendom, which I conceive no man of Learning and Sobriety would have grudged to grant him. It was alſo condeſcended to in the name of the <hi>Pope,</hi> that Marriage might be permitted to Prieſts; that the Communion might be adminiſtred <hi>ſub utraque ſpecie;</hi> and that the <hi>Liturgy</hi> might be officiated in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue. And though the <hi>Author</hi> adds not long after, that it was to be ſuſpected, <hi>That ſo far as the Inferiour Clergy and the People were concerned, the after performance was to be left to the Popes diſcretion;</hi> yet this was but his own Suſpicion, without ground at all. And to obtain a Reconciliation upon theſe advantages, <hi>the Archbiſhop had all the reaſon in the world to do as he did, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Lords-Table to be placed where the Altar ſtood, and making the accuſtomed Reverence in all approaches towards it,</hi> and acceſſes to it: In beautifying and adorning <hi>Churches,</hi> and celebrating the Divine Service with all due <hi>Selemnities;</hi> in taking care that all <hi>offenſive and exaſperating paſſages</hi> ſhould be expunged out of ſuch Books as were brought to the Preſs; and for reducing the extravagancy of ſome Opinions to an evener temper. His Majeſty had the like Reaſon alſo for Tolerating lawful Recreations on Sundays and Holydays.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Doctor goes on, <q>If you would know how far they had proceeded towards this <hi>happy Reconciliation,</hi> the <hi>Popes Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio</hi> will aſſure us thus, That the Univerſities, Biſhops, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of this Realm, <hi>did daily embrace Catholick Opinions,</hi> though they <hi>profeſſed not</hi> ſo much with Pen, or Mouth, for fear of the <hi>Puritans.</hi> For example, <hi>They hold that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is a true Church; That the Pope is Superiour to all Biſhops; That to him it appertains to call</hi> General Councils; <hi>That 'tis lawful to pray for the Souls of the departed; That Altars ought to be erected of Stone:</hi> In ſum, <hi>That they believe all that is taught by the</hi> Church, <hi>but not by the</hi> Court <hi>of</hi> Rome. Another of their Authors tells us, (as was elſewhere noted) That thoſe amongſt us of greateſt Worth, Learning, and Authority, began to love <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Moderation:</hi> That their Doctrines began to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61768:22"/>in many things, for which their Progenitors forſook the Viſible Church of Chriſt; As for example, <hi>The Pope not Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, Prayers for the Dead, Limbus Patrum, Pictures; That the Church hath Authority in determining Controverſies of Faith,</hi> and to interpret Scriptures about Free-will, Predeſtination, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Grace; That all our Works are not Sins, Merit of good Works, Inherent Juſtice, Faith alone doth juſtifie, Charity <hi>to be preferr'd before</hi> Knowledg, the Authority of Traditions, Commandments poſſible to be kept: That in Expoſition of the Scripture, they are by Canon bound to follow the Fathers; And that the once fearful names of <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Altars</hi> are uſed <hi>willingly in their Talk and Writings.</hi> In which compliances, ſo far forth as they ſpeak the Truth, ſaies <hi>Heylin</hi> (for in ſome points, through the Ignorance of the One and the Malice of the Other, they are much miſtaken) there is <hi>ſcarce any thing which may not very well conſiſt with the eſtabliſhed</hi> (though for a time diſcontinued) Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The Articles whereof, as the ſame <hi>Jeſuit</hi> hath obſerved, ſeem <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,</hi> or <hi>ambitious</hi> rather of ſome <hi>ſenſe</hi> wherein they may ſeem Catholick.</q> And ſuch a ſenſe is put upon them by him that calls himſelf <hi>Franciſcus â Sancta Clara,</hi> as before was ſaid. So far <hi>Heylir.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus to carry on this <hi>Recenciling Deſign,</hi> all the care imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable muſt be taken to <hi>humour the Papiſt,</hi> not only by proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the <hi>Puritan</hi> with the greateſt ſeverity; but the Pope muſt not any longer be ſtigmatized with the name of <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> all exaſperating paſſages in any Book brought to the Preſs, muſt be <hi>expung'd,</hi> not one word of the <hi>Gunpowder-Treaſon;</hi> for ſaid <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>'s chaplain, We are not now ſo angry with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as we were twenty years ago; and that there was no need to exaſperate them; and therefore the Book concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Gunpowder-Treaſon,</hi> muſt by no means be reprinted; the <hi>Divine Service</hi> muſt be in ſome reſpects altered; that whereas the <hi>Reformers</hi> in <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi>'s time had a greater kindneſs for the Pope than thoſe in <hi>H.</hi> 8. and <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. manifeſted by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punging a clauſe againſt the <hi>Pope,</hi> viz. <hi>From the tyranny of the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>and all his deteſtable enormities, Good Lord deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us.</hi> Even ſo in imitation, Archbiſhop <hi>Land</hi> changes ſome phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the Book of <hi>Prayers for the fifth of November.</hi> So far a Church of <hi>England</hi> Dr. To which I might add ſeveral other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61768:23"/>but I wiſh there had not been the woful occaſion of inſiſting on ſo much.</p>
                  <p>By this time the <hi>Reader</hi> may ſee cauſe to ſuſpect at leaſt the <hi>Deans Subſtitute,</hi> who in the Defence of the Dr. gives us the <hi>ſcheme</hi> of the <hi>old Grotian model,</hi> ſo much eſteemed by the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> who in his walking towards <hi>Rome,</hi> kept moſt exactly thereunto.</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding this, caution muſt be had, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach not all the Church of <hi>England</hi> as if they had been ſuch as this Author; for I do verily believe there are very few this day in <hi>England</hi> among the Conforming Clergy, who will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of this mans notion, but probably may judg themſelves as much concerned to oppoſe it, as any among the Diſſenters. I'm ſure <hi>Abbot</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Uſher</hi> Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> were perſons of quite another <hi>principle</hi> and <hi>temper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And not only <hi>Abbot</hi> and <hi>Uſher,</hi> but if we may judg of a <hi>Queen Elizabeth Proteſtant</hi> by the Writings of the famous <hi>Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> and Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> we may be ſure that this man (to ſay nothing of the <hi>Dean</hi>) hath (notwithſtanding the great talk of the glory of the firſt Reformation) forſaken the notion the old <hi>church of England</hi> had of the <hi>church,</hi> and of ſuch as are judged <hi>Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> falling in with the <hi>French Papacy</hi> about Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as I will evince in the next Section.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THAT our Author entertains notions about the nature of the <hi>Viſible Church,</hi> and of the <hi>Schiſmatical,</hi> very different from what the old <hi>Queen Elizabeth Proteſtants</hi> did, will appear with the greateſt conviction to ſuch as will but conſult the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> and Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> who do moſt expreſly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict what is aſſerted in the Dean's Defence.</p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:61768:23"/>
                  <p>The Dean's Defender doth extremely inſiſt on the <hi>Unity</hi> of the Univerſal Church, as what doth conſiſt in more than in the <hi>Unity of the Faith,</hi> though in <hi>combination</hi> of thoſe <hi>other graces</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> to wit, in an <hi>external communion,</hi> Take his own words in anſwer to a ſuppoſed objection.</p>
                  <p>P. 183. <hi>But though Faith</hi> alone <hi>is not ſufficient to Chriſtian U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, yet Faith in combination with thoſe other graces of Love, and Charity, and Peace, make a firm and laſting union. This I readily grant</hi> (ſaith he); <hi>but yet muſt add this one thing, That Chriſtian love, and charity, and peace, in the language of the New Teſtament, and of the ancient Fathers, when they ſignifie Chriſtian</hi> Unity, <hi>ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie alſo</hi> one communion, <hi>that is, the unity of a Body and Society which is external and viſible; and doth not only ſignifie the union of ſouls and affections, but the union of an external and viſible communion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>P. 184. By the <hi>union</hi> of an <hi>external</hi> and <hi>viſible communion,</hi> he means the living in Chriſtian communion and fellowſhip with each other; that is, a worſhipping God together after one and the ſame <hi>external and viſible manner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>P. 248. Moreover he adds, That ſuch as ſeparate themſelves from the <hi>external communion</hi> of any particular Church that is part of the Univerſal, do ſeparate themſelves from the Univerſal viſible Church. <hi>All Schiſmaticks,</hi> in his opinion, cut themſelves off from the viſible Catholick Church, even as all ſuch as are <hi>excommunicated,</hi> are cut off.</p>
                  <p>This is the notion of the Deans Subſtitute, which is as agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſenſe of the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> as 'tis in it ſelf <hi>groſly abſurd,</hi> and different from the doctrine of ſound <hi>Church of England Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That 'tis agreeable to the ſenſe of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> you'l find in a Conference between Dr. <hi>Peter Gunning,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Pierſon,</hi> with two Diſputants of the Romiſh Profeſſion. <hi>All Schiſmaticks</hi> (ſay the Romiſh Diſputants) <hi>are out of the Church, and quite ſeparate from it, as a part cut off is ſeparate from the body. Schiſmatick is a term contradiſtinct to Catholick. No Schiſmaticks can be true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Catholick church; for Schiſm,</hi> as they define it, <hi>is a voluntary ſeparation of one part from the whole true viſible church of Chriſt.</hi> The correſpondency that there is between the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Deans Defence,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Papiſts,</hi> about the <hi>formal reaſon of Schiſm,</hi> is as much as if the Defender had fetcht his Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                  <p>I ſay, ſuch a notion entertain'd by a profeſſed Proteſtant, is groſly abſurd; for it expoſeth him to the triumph of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-catholicks,</hi> it being impoſſible that the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their <hi>Schiſmatical</hi> Impoſitions, ſhould be eſteemed <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> by our Author. For all ſuch as are Schiſmatical, are (ſaith he) cut off from the viſible Catholick Church, of which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is acknowledged to be a <hi>true part,</hi> although from it theſe men, as they are Proteſtants, ſeparate, and ſo cut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves off from the Catholick viſible Church; for ſuch as ſeparate from any true part of the Catholick church, according unto him, do cut themſelves off from the Catholick church, and are Schiſmaticks.</p>
                  <p>Take a view then of the admirable abilities of our <hi>Auther,</hi> who muſt be conſidered to aſſert, either that the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> is <hi>Schiſmatical,</hi> or <hi>not.</hi> If <hi>not</hi> Schiſmatical, the <hi>church of England</hi> muſt be <hi>ſo,</hi> or otherwiſe there may be a ſeparation from the external communion of a particular Church that is a part of the Univerſal, without being guilty of Schiſm or of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating from the Catholick church. But if the Church of <hi>Rome be Schiſmatical,</hi> 'tis either cut off from the viſible Catholick church, or not; if <hi>not,</hi> then <hi>Schiſm</hi> conſiſts not in a ſeparating from the viſible Catholick church; that is, a man may be a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, and yet a member of the <hi>catholick church,</hi> a thing that our Author denies. But if the <hi>church of Rome</hi> be cut off from the viſible Catholick church, then the diſtreſſed <hi>Papiſt</hi> is in as ſad a condition as the Diſſenter; he is cut off from the church of Chriſt, and muſt be either damn'd, or ſaved by another <hi>Name</hi> than that of Jeſus Chriſt. If the <hi>latter,</hi> then farewell Chriſtian Religion. If the <hi>former,</hi> Where ſhall we find any part of the Univerſal Church beſide the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England?</hi> All the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> beyond the Sea are in the ſame ſtate with the Diſſenter at home; The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all ſuch as are in Subjection to that <hi>See,</hi> are cut off from the Viſible <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and it may be all the Eaſtern Churches in the World too; that is, the Catholick Viſible <hi>Church</hi> is confin'd within the Pale of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Pure <hi>Prelatical Donatiſm</hi> with a witneſs! Where will not Conſidence, when the attendant of Ignorance, lead men. Moreover,</p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:61768:24"/>
                  <p>This Notion as 'tis groſly abſurd, in like manner 'tis moſt contrary to the old <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Principles. Conſult <hi>Hooker</hi>'s <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Polity,</hi> lib. 3. and you'll find nothing more fully aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted than, <hi>That the Viſible Church of Jeſus Chriſt is therefore One in outward Profeſſion of thoſe things, which ſupernaturally appertain to the very eſſence of Chriſtianity, and are neceſſarily required in every particular Chriſtian man. — But we ſpeak now of the Viſible Church, whoſe Children are ſigned with this mark,</hi> One Lord, one Faith, one Baptifm. <hi>In whomſoever theſe things are, the Church doth acknowledg them for her Children.</hi> So far <hi>Hooker.</hi> But you will, it may be, object, That ſuch as are <hi>Schiſmatical,</hi> or <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate,</hi> may acknowledge <hi>One Lord,</hi> hold <hi>One Faith,</hi> and receive <hi>One Baptiſm,</hi> And ſhall ſuch be conſider'd as Members of the Viſible <hi>Church?</hi> Take Mr. <hi>Hooker's</hi> own words for an Anſwer, <hi>If by external Profeſſion they be Chriſtians, then are they of the Viſible Church of Chriſt; and Chriſtians by external Profeſſion are they all, whoſe mark of Recognizance hath in it thoſe things which we have mentioned; yea; although they be impious Idolaters, wicked Hereticks, Perſons Excommunicable, yea and caſt out for notorious Improbity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus 'tis evident, that Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> entertain'd apprehenſions quite contrary to thoſe of our <hi>Author;</hi> yea and Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> doth conſider the very Notion aſſerted by our Author to be Popiſh, which he doth as ſuch moſt excellently expoſe. <hi>As for the Act of Excommunication,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it neither ſhuts out from the</hi> Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, <hi>nor clean from the</hi> Viſible, <hi>but only from the Fellowſhip with the</hi> Viſible <hi>in holy Duties.</hi> In contradiction to which the <hi>Dean</hi>'s <hi>Subſtitute's</hi> Aſſertion is, p. 226. <hi>That Excommunication caſts a man out of the viſible Society of Chriſt's Church, not of this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church only, but of the Whole Chriſtian Church. — He that is caſt out of one Church, is thereby caſt out of all, and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Body of Chriſt, which is but One. — And therefore ſuch are out of a ſtate of Salvation.</hi> As if it had been ſaid in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> Such as are Excommunicate are ſhut out clean from the Viſible <hi>Church,</hi> yea and from the Myſtical <hi>Church.</hi> A Notion that Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> conſiders as held by none but <hi>Papiſts,</hi> for he immediatly addreſſeth himſelf to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> thus; <hi>With what congruity then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doth the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>deny, that her enemies whom ſhe holds always for Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, do at all appertain to the Church of Chriſt? — How ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61768:25"/>they us from being any part of the Church of Chriſt, under the colour and pretence of Hereſie, when they cannot but grant it poſſible, even for him</hi> [i. e. <hi>the Pope</hi>] <hi>to be as touching his own perſonal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion Heretical, who in their opinion not only is of the Church, but holdeth the chief place of Authority over the ſame?</hi> The like may be ſaid by way of Anſwer unto our <hi>Author.</hi> Moreover the <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Judicious</hi> Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> Son of the <hi>Church,</hi> is as full in contradicting what is aſſerted by our <hi>Author.</hi> For this Dr. of the <hi>Church,</hi> diſcourſing about the Schiſmatick, ſays, lib. 1. c. 13. <hi>That their departure is not ſuch, but that notwithſtanding their Schiſme, they are and remain parts of the Church of God. — Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, notwithſtanding their Separation, remain ſtill conjoyn'd with the reſt of God's people, in reſpect of the profeſſion of the whole ſaving Truth of God, all outward acts of Religion, and Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Power of Order, and Holy Sacraments, which they by vertue thereof adminiſter, and ſo ſtill are and remain parts of the Church of God.</hi> — The like is aſſerted of ſuch as are caſt out by <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,</hi> c. 15.</p>
                  <p>But I'll not enlarge any further, having ſufficiently evinc'd, that the Opinions of this man, who treats the Diſſenters with ſo much ſcorn and contempt, are ſuch as were antiently by Queen <hi>Elizabeths Proteſtants</hi> exploded as <hi>Popiſh;</hi> and at this very time, I verily believe, rejected by the greateſt part of the <hi>Epiſcopal Clergy;</hi> and that the <hi>Conteſt now</hi> is not ſo much between <hi>Diſſenters</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as between a few under the name of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> on the one part, and the greater number of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> with the Diſſenter, on the other. The <hi>former</hi> under the notion of running down Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, are preparing materials to meet the Papiſt: The <hi>other,</hi> to the end they may the more effectually prevent the Deſigns of <hi>Rome,</hi> have ſent forth their <hi>Plea for the Nonconformiſt,</hi> finding themſelves concern'd to check the Inſolence of thoſe, who in this day of common Calamity, would ruine the conſcientious <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Diſſenter.</p>
                  <p>This being ſo, I muſt beſeech the <hi>Reader</hi> not to miſapprehend me in what follows, as if I had been ſpeaking reproachfully of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> becauſe I cannot but diſcover, how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable the Sentunents of the Deans Subſtitute about <hi>Church-Government</hi> are, unto thoſe embrac'd by the <hi>French Papiſt.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>This is what hath been aſſerted by the Council at <hi>Constance, Anno</hi> 1315. and by that of <hi>Baſil, Anno</hi> 1431. and by many Learned Divines in the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> viz. <hi>Cardinal Camera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſis, Jeannes Gerſon, Jacobus Almain, Nicolas Cuſanus, Panor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitanus,</hi> and his Maſter Cardinal <hi>Florentinus,</hi> as alſo by <hi>Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenſis.</hi>

                     <hi>Gerſon</hi> being a <hi>Chancellor at Paris,</hi> had many followers among the <hi>French,</hi> who at this very day aſſert, That the <hi>Supreme Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent part of the Univerſal Church,</hi> is a <hi>General Council;</hi> for which reaſon I conclude, that ſuch as aſſert, That a General Council is the Political Head or Regent part of the Univerſal Church, are in the number of <hi>French Papists.</hi>

                  <p>Thus our Learned Gentleman in one place endeavouring to fetch the <hi>Dean</hi> off from that difficulty Mr. <hi>Humphreys</hi> had dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him unto, concerning the <hi>constitutive Regent part</hi> of the <hi>church of England</hi> as <hi>National,</hi> doth ſay, <hi>The Dean anſwers in my poor opinion, with great judgment and conſideration, We deny any neceſſity of ſuch a constitutive Regent part—For though a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional church be one body, yet it is not ſuch a political body as Mr.</hi> B. <hi>deſcribes,</hi> i. e. <hi>there is no ſuch Government as cannot be without a</hi> Pars Regens &amp; Subdita, p. 562. And yet he grants, That Church-Governours united and governing by conſent, are the <hi>pars Imperans,</hi> and <hi>christian peoplo</hi> in obedience to the Laws of our Saviour, ſubmitting to ſuch government, are the <hi>pars ſubdita.</hi> p. 565. All which is true (ſaith he) without a Conſtitutive Regent Head, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> There is a Governing part or a <hi>pars Regens;</hi> or to ſpeak Engliſh, a Conſtitutive Regent part or Head, without a Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive Regent Head. The like is aſſerted of the Univerſal Church, namely, That it is a Church governed by the Colledge of Biſhops, which Colledge of Biſhops are the <hi>Pars Imperans,</hi> though not the conſtitutive Regent part. For we muſt allow him to wallow in his contradictions. But a Governing part there is in the Univerſal Church, which Governing part is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of Biſhops.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>The Governours of the Univerſal</hi> Church <hi>are Catholick Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in</hi> Council, who though they are equals, and as ſuch have no Superiority over one another, <hi>p.</hi> 213. yet the Colledge, or theſe Biſhops aſſembled, have Authority and command over any of its collegues; that is, every ſingle Biſhop is under the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and command of this Foreign Council.</p>

                  <p>The reſult of all is, That the Catholick Church of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>A Notion that doth not only ſubvert the preſent conſtitution of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that thinks not it ſelf accountable to any ſuch Forreign Power; but moreover in it ſelf as groſly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, as 'tis ſuited to the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Caſſandrian,</hi> or the <hi>Grotian</hi> Model, leading us all to <hi>Unite</hi> with all the other parts of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> by rendring an unwarrantable Obedience unto ſuch a Governing Power as is ſeldom in being, and when ſo, as dangerous and of as deſtructive a tendency to the Government of Jeſus Chriſt, as that of the <hi>Italian</hi> Papacy.</p>
                  <p>But whether our Author had a clear proſpect of this Intreague, when at firſt he was put on it, I'll not venture to determine; it being ſufficient that I have fully proved, That the <hi>New-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell'd Epiſcopacy</hi> of this Gentleman is the ſame with that of the <hi>French;</hi> which is as inconſiſtent with the old-eſtabliſh'd Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy of our <hi>Church,</hi> as is the <hi>Italian</hi> Papacy. For if our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor may ſafely exceed the bounds of thoſe Laws, that do with the greateſt Severity forbid our <hi>Appeal</hi> to any <hi>Forreign Power,</hi> by addreſſing himſelf unto a <hi>Forreign Colledge,</hi> Why may not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preſume to make his <hi>Appeal to the Court of</hi> Rome? What Reaſon can be given for the <hi>One,</hi> which will not prove cogent for the <hi>Other;</hi> eſpecially to ſuch, who, living where they have conſtant experiences of the excellency of a <hi>Monarchical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in the <hi>State,</hi> may be eaſily induced to conclude Monarchy as admirable in the <hi>Church,</hi> and then farewel Impoſſibilities, viz. <hi>General Councils,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Monarch in the <hi>Church</hi> being much more deſirable.</p>
                  <p>Having thus given a true ſtate of the Controverſie, whereby we find our Author to agree exactly with the <hi>French Papiſt</hi> about <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>That this may the more clearly and with the greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction be performed, I will be ſo juſt, as to do our <hi>Author</hi> all the right imaginable, by taking notice what he ſeems to aſſert, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61768:29"/>what he's reſolv'd to deny, and accordingly proceed to the ſtricteſt diſquiſition after the <hi>Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Author aſſerts, <hi>That the Univerſal Church,</hi> as ſuch, <hi>is the Seat of Government,</hi> 'tis a <hi>Body under Government;</hi> as much as if it had been ſaid, There muſt be in it a <hi>Governing,</hi> and a <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned</hi> part. It being impoſſible that <hi>Government</hi> ſhould be without <hi>Order,</hi> which Order is <hi>ſecundum ſub, &amp; Supra.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver there is Government, there muſt be a Superiour part Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, and an Inferiour Governed. There muſt be <hi>Dominus &amp; Subditus.</hi> This our Author ſeems to grant, when he doth to this Aſſertion of the Government of the <hi>Univerſal Church,</hi> add his thoughts about the <hi>Governours</hi> thereof; which, he ſaies, are the <hi>Univerſal Biſhops aſſembled in Council.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But alrhough this is what our Author doth aſſert, he doth not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding reſolutely deny the <hi>Univerſal Church to be a Political Body;</hi> what he ſaith of a <hi>National,</hi> that he aſſerts of the <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church, both</hi> which are <hi>Govern'd Societies,</hi> but <hi>neither a Political Body;</hi> p. 564, 565. All which is to fetch off the Dean from Mr. <hi>Humphrey's</hi> and Mr. <hi>B's</hi> unanſwerable <hi>Queries</hi> concerning the <hi>conſtitutive Regent part of a National church,</hi> whoſe exiſtence muſt be acknowledged, if a National <hi>church</hi> as ſuch be a Governed <hi>church,</hi> or a Body Politick; but yet this cannot be found out. For which reaſon they diſtinguiſh between a <hi>Governed Society</hi> and a <hi>Body Politick;</hi> between a <hi>Governing</hi> and a <hi>Regent part,</hi> and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, <hi>That the National church is a Govern'd Society,</hi> but not <hi>a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Politick;</hi> that it hath a Governing, but not a Regent part; the like of an <hi>Univerſal church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the true ſtate of our Author's Judgment, wherein we have an admirable account of the Gentleman's acute diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, the excellency of which I'll leave to the entertainment of his Admirers; and if he pleaſe, conſider the Notion according to his own ſtating it: that is, to gratifie him, I won't inſiſt on the word <hi>Policy,</hi> nor <hi>Regent,</hi> nor <hi>conſtitutive Regent</hi> part; but only on <hi>government, Governours,</hi> and <hi>Governed;</hi> and ſo our Enquiry being about the <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Univerſal Church,</hi> we muſt conſider what is neceſſary thereunto, and ſee whether what our Author aſſerts be agreeable unto ſuch a conſtitution; for if not ſo, 'tis far from Truth.</p>
                  <p>To conſider what it is that is neceſſary to the conſtitution of any <hi>Governed Body;</hi> that is, what is ſo neceſſary, that the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61768:29"/>abſence thereof is deſtructive to the Conſtitution? To this I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</p>
                  <p>That a <hi>Governing,</hi> and a <hi>Governed</hi> part is ſo neceſſary unto <hi>Goverement,</hi> that where either one of theſe be abſent, there can be no Government. A Governed Body cannot be without a Governing part, neither can this be without a part Governed. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment doth neceſſarily infer both theſe; remove either one, &amp; the Government is deſtroyed. Government is a Relation reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from that mutual reſpect the Governing and Governed parts have to each other, whence as <hi>Sublato uno Relatorum tollitur &amp; alterum;</hi> and where there is nor Subject nor Term, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> nor <hi>Relate</hi> nor <hi>Correlate,</hi> there can be no <hi>Relation.</hi> Remove the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning part from the Univerſal or National <hi>Church,</hi> and the Government ceaſes. Paternity may be where there is no Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, aſſoon as Government without a Governing part. Whence I infer, <hi>That where there is a</hi> Fixed Government, <hi>there muſt be a</hi> fixed Governing part.</p>
                  <p>This premiſed, Let us next enquire, whether or no what our Author aſſerts, be ſuitable to this <hi>undoubted Rule?</hi> Doth he ſhew us ſuch a Governing part? The Government is a conſtant fixed Government, but where is the conſtant fixed Governing part? 'Tis a <hi>General Council,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>i. e.</hi> the univerſal Biſhops in their Colledge aſſembled. But is this a fixed Governing part? Is it not evident to an ordinary capacity, that the aſſembling ſuch a Council of all the Biſhops in the World, is a difficulty inſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and that without ſuch an Aſſembly, 'tis impoſſible they ſhould by joynt conſent govern the Univerſal <hi>Church.</hi> The aſtembling of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Biſhops is as eaſie as the gathering together their conſent <hi>per literas format as,</hi> and much more conducive to the deſired End; becauſe when aſſembled they can debate the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters before 'em, and with the greater judgment give their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations.</p>
                  <p>But 'tis well known, that had ſuch an Aſſembly been poſſible, yet the <hi>Church</hi> of God for the firſt 300 years, had no ſuch Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, excepting that in the Apoſtles days, <hi>i. e.</hi> it had no ſuch <hi>Governing part;</hi> which is as if it had been ſaid, There was no Government in the <hi>Univerſal Church</hi> the firſt 300 years.</p>
                  <p>To gratifie our Author, Let us ſuppoſe that the <hi>Univerſal Church</hi> is as ſuch a Governed Society, and that it hath its Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61768:30"/>But though this be ſo, yet it muſt be ſtill acknowedged, that a <hi>Governour</hi> cannot be without <hi>Power</hi> to Govern; I would therefore beſeech my Author to ſhew me, What is that Power with which this Colledge of Biſhops are inveſted? Is it <hi>Legiſlative</hi> only, or alſo <hi>Executive?</hi> Whether the one or the other, is it in the Colledge <hi>Subjectively</hi> and <hi>Formally,</hi> or only in 'em as <hi>in fine ſeu regulante,</hi> or <hi>ſupplente,</hi> or How? 'Twould be neceſſary that our Author conſult the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Doctors, if he will ſpeak to the purpoſe, when he eſpouſes their Notion.</p>
                  <p>Let our Author aſſert as it pleaſeth him at an adventure, it matters not, for his Notion is ſuch as neceſſarily directs us to conclude what he muſt, if he will be conſiſtent with himſelf, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, and that is this, <hi>All Church-Government is Univerſal, and as ſuch it muſt be exerciſed;</hi> no one being a Governour in the <hi>Church,</hi> but he that is a Catholick Officer: That the due courſe of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing this Power is, when it flows originally from the Head unto all its Members. That it flows from the Inviſible, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unſeen Head in Heaven immediately unto the viſible Head on Earth, is granted by all thoſe who aſſert an Univerſal <hi>Church</hi>-Government; though there is a Diſpute among the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> whether this Head be the Council, or the Pope. As it flows immediately from Chriſt to the viſible Head, ſo it proceeds from this viſible Head unto the Patriarchs, from thence to the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans, from thence to the Dioceſans. For which Reaſon if any are injur'd by their Dioceſan, they may Appeal to their Metropolitan, from thence to their Patriarch, from thence to the Pope or Council. This our Author muſt hold. That there may be no wrong done the Little Ones of Chriſt, if any be grieved by <hi>One,</hi> he may Appeal unto an Higher, till he comes unto the Higheſt Power on Earth; from whence if he find not relief, he muſt acquieſce, leaving the whole to him who is in Heaven. But if there be no conſtant viſible Head actually exiſting, where ſhall the grieved lodge his laſt Appeal? The Dean's Subſtitute ſuppoſes an equality of Power in Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, Metropolitans, and Dioceſans; whence if his Dioceſan doth abuſe his Power, he is not accountable to any Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan, nor Patriarch, but only unto the <hi>Catholick Colledge.</hi> The which being ſo, 'twill follow, That Executive Power muſt be lodg'd in ſome Supreme Head <hi>Subjectively,</hi> who can receive
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61768:30"/>Appeals: I ſay <hi>Subjectively,</hi> or Formally, and not only <hi>Virtually;</hi> for 'tis an Executive Power only that can relieve in this caſe; which cannot <hi>Actually</hi> be, where 'tis only <hi>Virtually.</hi> For which Reaſon 'tis evident, that according to our Author, there muſt be a <hi>fixed Governing part</hi> inveſted with an <hi>Executive Power,</hi> from whom relief is to be expected, if at any time the Dioceſan doth abuſe his Power; which Governing part muſt be either a <hi>Colledge of Biſhops,</hi> or one <hi>ſingle Perſon.</hi> And if the obtaining the <hi>former</hi> be, as indeed 'tis impoſſible, the acknowledging the <hi>latter</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee how fairly this Gentleman at length leads us to <hi>Rome,</hi> or ſome other Pope, as the only neceſſary way of governing the <hi>Church.</hi> In doing which, he doth but carry on the Project, of which Sir <hi>Francis Winnington</hi> takes notice at the Trial of the Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> when he aſſured the Lords, <hi>That as an encouragement to the POPISH PLOTTERS, there did appear in ſome men too eaſie and favourable a Diſpoſition towards the PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PISTS. They were grown ſtrangely MODERATE towards theſe OLD ENEMIES of our Church and State. New PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JECTS of</hi> RECONCILING <hi>of us were ſet on foot, and Books were written to diſtinguiſh the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>from the Court of</hi> Rome. <hi>One of thoſe Books, which was Printed the year before the Diſcovery of the Plot, pretends, That there ought to be a Difference made between Papiſts of LOYAL and DISLOYAL Principles. This Book, as it was written more</hi> ARTIFICIALLY <hi>than the reſt, and Publiſhed in ſo Critical and Dangerous a Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, deſerves, and I doubt not in time will have a particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. 'Tis eaſie to believe how great Encouragement this muſt give to the</hi> ROMANISTS, <hi>to ſee how very willing men were to meet them, and how freely the Pen was drawn in their Favour.</hi>

                  <p>By this time the <hi>Reader</hi> may eaſily ſee who 'tis that is ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the <hi>Popiſh Deſign,</hi> and without any further help clearly perceive what is the Tendency of our Author's Diſcourſe. There remaineth only one objection which calls for our obſervation, the which can be no ſooner remov'd, but the <hi>Reader</hi> may be fully ſatisfied in this, <hi>viz.</hi> That 'tis not impoſſible for one who Aſſents and Conſents to the Thirty nine Articles, the Book of Common-prayer, and of Homilies, to drive on a <hi>French</hi> (not to ſay a <hi>Popiſh</hi>) Deſign.</p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:61768:31"/>
                  <p>The Objection that occurs to a common capacity, is, How can ſuch that give in Aſſent and Conſent to all that is <hi>ſaid</hi> of the excellency of the preſent Eſtabliſhment, do any thing that tends to its ſubverſion?</p>
                  <p>The Anſwer is eaſie; You muſt diſtinguiſh between the <hi>ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> and the <hi>things</hi> aſſented and conſented unto. For you do not Aſſent unto the <hi>Sayings,</hi> though about the excellency of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Eſtabliſhment, but the <hi>Things;</hi> for ſaith he, p. 105. We do not give our Aſſent to every <hi>ſaying</hi> in the Common-prayer-book, but to every <hi>thing</hi> which is contained in, and preſcrib'd by it; that is, what we are bound to uſe. Whence obſerve, That ſeeing a Papiſt can comply with all the Ceremonies in uſe, even when he cannot Aſſent to all the Sayings in the Common-prayer-book, he may give in his Aſſent, and Conſent, and be as true a Son of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as our Author is.</p>

                  <p>In <hi>fine,</hi> 'tis remarkable, That notwithſtanding the many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations made of a propenſion toward a <hi>real union</hi> between <hi>Conformiſt</hi> and <hi>Nonconformiſt,</hi> nothing is more notoriouſly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, than that <hi>thoſe</hi> among the Diſſenters who are <hi>moſtly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> to ſome compliances with the <hi>Epiſcopal,</hi> are above all others hated and contemned by ſuch as our Author.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome among Diſſenters, (namely the <hi>Reverend</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi>) whoſe Moderation in theſe things hath been ever ſince their ejection for their Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity practically diſcover'd to the whole Kingdom. They fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently attend on the <hi>Conformiſts Miniſtry,</hi> not ſcrupling to be preſent at their <hi>prayers,</hi> nor at the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Yea, they ſhew with the greateſt evidence deſirable, That their <hi>diſpoſition</hi> toward the accommodating the matters in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61768:32"/>between <hi>Conformiſt</hi> and <hi>Nonconformiſt</hi> is ſuch, that nothing but <hi>apparent ſin</hi> ſhould hinder their conformity. But yet none more expos'd to contempt by the Dean and his Subſtitute, than theſe men! 'Tis Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> who writes in a continued fit of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. 'Tis he is the man to be <hi>pitied;</hi> and no wonder, for his Subſtitute gives great reaſon for it, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is the <hi>Judas,</hi> the moſt <hi>dangerous Enemy</hi> that lodges in the boſome of the <hi>Church;</hi> a <hi>Cataline,</hi> a <hi>Protean Religioniſt, who transforms himſelf into all ſhapes;</hi> and <hi>differs from the</hi> Hobbiſt <hi>only in this, That the</hi> Hobbiſt <hi>is for being always of his Prince's Religion,</hi> but <hi>he is always for being againſt it.</hi> P. 234.</p>
                  <p>This is the character which the Dean's Defender gives of that <hi>Reverend and Peaceable Divine,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and that principally, becauſe he is <hi>ſo much inclin'd to unite</hi> with the Conformiſt; as if the Gentleman, and ſuch as are of his <hi>Gang,</hi> were afraid of a Proteſtant Union.</p>
                  <p>But, Sir, is this the way to Union? Is this the way to peace? What, to let out all your wrath, and rage, and fury, againſt ſuch as are moſt peaceable, and ready to unite with you? What thinking and unbiaſſed mind can be perſuaded to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That thoſe very men, who after ſuch an unclean and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent manner revile the peace-maker, are in love with peace? Is it poſſible that he who conſiders ſo complying a perſon as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is, to be for that reaſon a <hi>Judas,</hi> a <hi>Cataline,</hi> a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tean Religioniſt,</hi> ſhould be pleaſed with his compliances?</p>
                  <p>This certainly doth but diſcover, That if the <hi>Nonconform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts</hi> could conſcientiouſly conform to more than really they can, it would not conduce to their relief, if ſuch as our Author could prevent; They muſt do all you exact, or elſe no peace to be expected; they muſt comply with every <hi>iota,</hi> or no Union. Moreover, when they have conformed to every impos'd <hi>iota,</hi> they muſt alſo ſeparate themſelves from all the good Chriſtians in the Land that are not of their perſuaſion in every thing, or be ſtill <hi>Schiſmatical:</hi> yea, though a man conforms, if he be more of a <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> temper</hi> than our hot and fiery <hi>Author,</hi> that is, if he be but <hi>compaſſi nate towards Diſſenters,</hi> ſhewing a tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> 'tis enough to make him the object of their rage. Witneſs he <hi>Countrey Conformiſt,</hi> who notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greatneſs of his Learning, and the excellency of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61768:32"/>his temper, diſcovered in his <hi>Remarks,</hi> is treated by the Dean's Subſtitute, <hi>Pref.</hi> p. 6. as one who is for <hi>raiſing a Civil War for the pulling down Church and State, to ſet up a Presbyterian Parity.</hi> Thus they deal with ſuch as are for Peace, and yet would be thought to be for <hi>great Abatements</hi> for peace ſake, as men ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely diſpos'd to unite with us; that is, they are ſo, if it may be without parting with one <hi>iota</hi> for Union.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>High-flown Conformiſts,</hi> with whom only our preſent Controverſie is, are very much for Union, even when 'tis moſt obvious, that the utmoſt they are for, is the expoſing the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter: Let the Diſſenters do what they can, theſe men will not be pleaſed. There are ſeveral <hi>ſizes</hi> among the Diſſenters, ſome can <hi>Conſcientiouſly do more for Union</hi> than <hi>others</hi> can; but <hi>they</hi> that do the moſt, are not freer from the laſh of their Tongues and Pens, nor from the execution of their Laws than the other. If they come not to <hi>Church,</hi> then they are <hi>Diſobedient, Seditious, Factions,</hi> and what not? If they do go to the <hi>Church,</hi> they are <hi>Judaſſes, Catalines, Protean</hi> Religioniſts, <hi>Hobbiſts,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things conſider'd, Let any moderate man judge, what 'tis they'll part with for Union, what are thoſe <hi>Iota</hi>'s. Not that I accuſe all Conformiſts, but a few, even thoſe only who are of the ſame <hi>ſtamp</hi> with our <hi>Author,</hi> who ſeem to raze the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the preſent Conſtitution; For I am confident, that there are many of the very <hi>Clergy,</hi> who deſire nothing ſo much as the Peace of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>relieving tender Conſciences.</hi> And as for the <hi>Magiſtracy,</hi> 'tis evident, that as <hi>few,</hi> or none delight to execute the Laws againſt Diſſenters, even ſo 'tis in the heart of our <hi>Sovereign,</hi> the <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> and of the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> that an Expedient be found out for the <hi>uniting Proteſtants,</hi> and the eaſing thoſe burdens that have ſo long lain on Diſſenters; ſo that through God's Grace we may ſee a <hi>happy Union</hi> among <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> even when the <hi>Dean</hi> and his <hi>Subſtitute</hi> will not part with an <hi>Iota</hi> for it.</p>
                  <p>But you'll ſay, the Dr. makes Propoſals for Union in the very <hi>Preface</hi> againſt which I write. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If the Doctor contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts himſelf, whoſe fault is that? But 2. 'Tis true the <hi>Dean</hi> made a Propoſal of ſome <hi>Abatements</hi> in order unto Union, but unto whom? Let our skilful <hi>Interpreter,</hi> the <hi>Dean's Subſtitute</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. <hi>The Dean</hi> ſaith, <hi>We do heartily and ſincerely deſire Union,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61768:33"/>
                     <hi>The meaning of which is,</hi> (ſaith our <hi>Dean</hi>'s <hi>Interpreter</hi>) <hi>that we are ſincerely willing to make any Condeſcenſions for Peace-ſake,</hi> which will not overthrow the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England, nor</hi> inſinuate a falſe and ſcandalous Accuſation of the Unlawfulneſs of our Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Rites of Worſhip, <hi>which we cannot do with a</hi> ſafe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <hi>becauſe we believe the contrary,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And we are not ſo charitable to give eaſe to other mens Conſciences to injure our own, and thereby condemn the Reformation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In anſwer unto this, I muſt ſay, what I did unto the <hi>Dean,</hi> [<hi>Enquiry,</hi> p. 33.] It muſt be obſerved, That <hi>Diſſenters not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming</hi> to Epiſcopacy and Ceremonies, is a judging them Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful; which is in the Opinion of our Churchmen, a caſting a Reproach and Diſhonour on the Reformation of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. To which I add, That the <hi>Churches</hi> parting with any of thoſe Rites of Worſhip, which the Diſſenters cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienciouſly comply with, may inſinuate into the minds of ſome men the Notion of their Unlawfulneſs. Whence, if there muſt be no Abatements made, but ſuch as do not inſinuate an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs in the <hi>Epiſcopal Conſtitution,</hi> nor in the <hi>Rites of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> what manner of Abatements can there be made? 'Tis evident then, that the Doctor's <hi>Propoſal</hi> made with ſuch Reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Limitations for Union, is but a more plauſible way of denying it. But what is the great Reaſon, why there muſt be no ſuch compliance, as may be attended with ſuch Inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but this, 'Tis inconſiſtent with the <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> or rather of the <hi>Reformers:</hi> For I remember, that when the talk was about blaſting the Honour of the firſt <hi>Reformation,</hi> the meaning was, the caſting a reproach upon <hi>Cramner, Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> &amp;c. the firſt <hi>Reformers;</hi> And why may we not underſtand it now in the ſame ſenſe in this place? And if ſo, How is the Charge untrue? or how comes it to be either <hi>Impudent</hi> or <hi>Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious?</hi> But here is the Talk of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> They <hi>cannot do it with ſafe Conſcience,</hi> this ſurprizeth me.

                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:61768:33"/>that <hi>Epiſcopacy is of Divine Right,</hi> and conſequently <hi>Unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable.</hi> For they muſt not admit of any thing contrary to the Opinion of their Conſciences; ſtill Fanaticiſme, a juſtifying the Diſſenter, who cannot <hi>Conſciencouſly</hi> Conform! Only there is an untoward Inſinuation in't on the Doctor's part, namely, That the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Conſtitution is of Divine Right, and that our Church-men are not overmuch owing to our Governours for its Eſtabliſhment; That if our <hi>Governours</hi> ſhould go about to make any <hi>Alteration</hi> in the preſent Conſtitution, they offend God: For which our Governours won't give them any great thanks. But ſure a mans <hi>Conſcience</hi> may permit another, whom he cannot change, to do that which it will not permit himſelf to do.</p>
                  <p>Thus having conſidered the <hi>Overt acts</hi> of the Enquirers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Immodeſty, let our <hi>Author</hi> make the moſt on't, and let the <hi>Reader</hi> judge, Whether there was not ſomewhat more than the <hi>Reflection</hi> on the <hi>Enquirer,</hi> that brought forth his firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Whether his propenſions to favour our Common Enemy the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> were not ſtronger than his Averſions to the Enquirers Immodeſty?</p>
                  <p>Here I would have put an end unto this Chapter, had it not been requiſite to take ſome notice of the like <hi>Treatment</hi> which he affords Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Humfrey,</hi> the <hi>Country-Conformiſt,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Owen.</hi> Not that I deſign to enlarge on this Subject, but only to give the <hi>Reader</hi> a Taſte of the <hi>Modeſty</hi> of our <hi>Author,</hi> who accuſes others ſo much of <hi>Immodeſty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. As for his uſage of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> 'tis ſuch, that how immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſoever I may be eſteem'd, I muſt ſolemnly profeſs, that I cannot without defiling my Pen expreſs it aright: I will not therefore take any other notice of it than to ſay, It becomes not a <hi>Man,</hi> much leſs a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> much leſs a <hi>Presbyter of the Church of</hi> England, to treat the unworthieſt of men after ſuch a rate as he has treated Mr. <hi>B.</hi> I am ſure, 'tis recorded in the Sacred Scriptures, that <hi>Michael the Archangel durſt not bring a railing Accuſation againſt the Devil.</hi> And Oh, How unmeet then is it for this man of inferiour Dignity, to rail at one ſo eminent in Piety and Learning!</p>
                  <p>Methinks 'tis a pitiful ſhift, when men have nothing but hard words to anſwer hard Arguments with: A way the moſt inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to the deſired End, <hi>viz.</hi> the confuting a Learned Adverſary;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61768:34"/>but the beſt perhaps that can be to come off. For really when there is ſo little of ſolid Anſwer to what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath urged againſt the Dean, this Gentlemans Treatiſe is beneath Mr. <hi>B's</hi> notice; and his hard words deſerving no other Reply than, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee.</hi>

                  <p>'Tis well known that the <hi>Reverend Mr. H.</hi> is a <hi>grave</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, it may be twenty years elder than Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> for which reaſon a reproof (though plain and open) may be <hi>proper</hi> in him, which would not become me or this <hi>Author;</hi> eſpecially, conſidering that this Mr. <hi>H.</hi> is <hi>one</hi> whoſe inclinations to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity are ſuch, that there can be nothing of humour to keep him from a cloſure with the <hi>Dean,</hi> or to provoke him to an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary quarrel;</hi> which is enough to engage a judicious perſon to conclude, That if <hi>ſuch a man</hi> as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> treats the Dean ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is ſomewhat extraordinary in the Dr. that call'd for it.</p>
                  <p>In this opinion I am abundantly confirmed, when I remember what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in the Preface of his Second <hi>Defence</hi> ſayes of him, which is, That he handles the Dr. <hi>ſomewhat freely,</hi> that is, as the <hi>Countrey Conformiſt</hi> interprets it, very <hi>honeſtly,</hi> as the Dr. deſerv'd; and for this reaſon, though our <hi>Author,</hi> who it may be hath not that ſenſe of <hi>Conſcientious duties</hi> upon him, as theſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have, does <hi>blame</hi> it, yet it may be worthy <hi>commendation.</hi> For what ſhould tempt ſo <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Judicious</hi> a perſon, as the

                     <hi>Countrey Conformiſt</hi> is, to be ſo full in approving it, unleſs the very ſubject-matter of the Drs. Diſcourſe, or the mode of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging it, did ſuggeſt, that the greateſt kindneſs could be ſhewn the Dr. was to deal plainly and uprightly in diſcovering unto him his <hi>ſin?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this is enough to <hi>expoſe the Countrey conformiſt</hi> preſently to the ſame laſh. He is alſo <hi>immodeſt;</hi> and why? ſurely for no other reaſon, that I can imagine, but becauſe he is not afraid to ſpeak the <hi>Truth,</hi> and to give to the world an aſſurance, That the <hi>Dean</hi>'s Diſcourſe was not grateful unto every Conformiſt; and that therefore, whoever would inſinuate as if the Dr. had given us the ſenſe of all his Conforming Brethren in that great Book, would abuſe and injure ſome of the moſt <hi>judicious</hi> and <hi>godly</hi> among the <hi>Conforming Clergy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He hath really done the <hi>true Church of England</hi> great right, in making not only his <hi>Reflections on the Deans Preface,</hi> but alſo his <hi>Remarks</hi> on the <hi>Book</hi> it ſelf, a <hi>Treatiſe</hi> worthy the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Dean,</hi> ſeeing the anſwering that, as appears by our Authors ſilence, is beyond his ſtrength; that is, it is ſo candidly wrote, as he ſhould be aſhamed to except againſt it.</p>
                  <p>I need not ſay any thing concerning the <hi>Reverend Dr. Owen,</hi> becauſe as our Author had ſpoken little of his perſon (though more than became him) but <hi>leſs</hi> by way of anſwer to his <hi>Book.</hi> However it muſt be remembred, That ſeeing our Author found himſelf neceſſitated to run unto the Tents of the <hi>French Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt</hi> for Armour to batter down the Notion Dr. O. hath eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in proving a <hi>particular Church to be the</hi>

               <p>However, let me ask the Author what 'tis that provokes him to talk ſo confidently of the moſt <hi>ſecret motions</hi> of my ſoul? Why muſt expoſing the <hi>Dean</hi> to <hi>popular edium</hi> and <hi>fury,</hi> be my end? What overt-acts were there of ſuch a deſign? Did I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent the <hi>Dean</hi> in any one inſtance? Or did I make it my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to carp at every little thing in his <hi>Preface?</hi> Did I inſiſt on far-fetcht conſequences, or force any undue ſenſe on his words? Did I ſpeak all I could to ſhew the Tendency of his <hi>Preface,</hi> or whole Book? Or did I take notice of any thing more than what was neceſſary for the clearing up the innocency of the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? As to theſe particulars, you cannot faſten your Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; But yet my aim muſt be expoſing the Dean; and why ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61768:35"/>him? What, was the <hi>Dean</hi> expos'd, becauſe the charge with which he would load Diſſenters, was ſuch, that the very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating and confuting it, tends to his Reproach? If ſo, whoſe fault is that?</p>
               <p>I do freely confeſs, That I believe the <hi>Deans</hi> charge againſt Diſſenters to be ſo indecent, that thereby he hath loſt very much of that Eſteem he formerly had among Judicious Gentlemen of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> but this is not my fault, nor an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that what I wrote in the Defence of the Diſſenter, was with a deſign of expoſing the <hi>Dean.</hi> A thing I could have eaſily done, without either wreſting his words, or impoſing a forreign ſenſe on 'em.</p>
               <p>How eaſily could I have imitated the famous Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> and have pick'd ſuch paſſages out of the <hi>Dean</hi>'s Diſcourſes, as that <hi>Great Prelate</hi> did out of <hi>Harding,</hi> and have ſhewed how unlike himſelf the <hi>Dean</hi> acted, in contemning and pitying the Reverend Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> in comparing the judicious Mr. <hi>Alſop</hi>'s Diſcourſe to the <hi>Bird</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> made up of Face and Feathers; and repreſenting Mr. <hi>Alſop</hi> himſelf ſo, as if <hi>all things had not been right,</hi> that is, as if he had been mad. Of this I the rather take notice, becauſe a very ſerious perſon on the reading the <hi>Dean</hi>'s Book, came to me on purpoſe, to enquire whether Mr. <hi>Alſop</hi> was never mad? If not, ſaid he, Why did Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> write as if he had? Many other things of a more <hi>uncomely</hi> aſpect I could have taken out of the <hi>Dean</hi>'s Writings, but I wav'd it, it not being my work in that <hi>Enquiry,</hi> or this <hi>Reply,</hi> to acquaint the World with the <hi>naevi</hi> of the <hi>Reverend</hi> Doctor; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore notwithſtanding the many provocations you have given me in your <hi>Defence of the Dean,</hi> I'm reſolved to treat the <hi>Dean</hi> more civilly than he did Mr. <hi>B.</hi> or Mr. <hi>A.</hi> or than you have Mr. <hi>B.</hi> or Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and the <hi>Country Conformiſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The expoſing men to <hi>Popular Odium</hi> and <hi>Fury,</hi> becomes only ſuch who hate <hi>Perſons</hi> more than their <hi>Opinions,</hi> and who have little to offer againſt their Adverſaries beſides hard words.

               <p>'Tis true, I ſhew'd the <hi>Tendency</hi> of his Diſcourſe, which I thought to be for the advancing the <hi>Papal Intereſt.</hi> The very thing the Dean's Subſtitute drives at in the Dean's Defence, wherein our Author goes much further than the <hi>Dean,</hi> or at leaſt hath expreſſed his ſentiments more <hi>freely,</hi> and <hi>with leſs caution.</hi> But ſhall this be conſidered as an expoſing you to <hi>popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar odium and fury?</hi> You aſſert, <hi>That the Univerſal Church is a governed Society;</hi> That <hi>the Biſhops in their Colledg are the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning part;</hi> That <hi>the Biſhops conven'd in their Aſſembly, do not meet only for mutual</hi> Help and Concord, <hi>but for</hi> Regiment.

                  <p>THE <hi>Deans</hi> Subſtitute doth at laſt apply himſelf to the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Doctor,</hi> in doing which he conſiders the <hi>Reaſons</hi> I collected out of the <hi>Dean's Preface,</hi> which the <hi>Dean</hi> urges to engage the Reader to believe, that the Diſſenters are a people carrying on the <hi>Popiſh Deſigns.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Diſſenters have embraced the Jeſuits Principles about Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Prayer, and a more pure way of Worſhip.</hi> This is what I obſerv'd out of Dr. <hi>Still.</hi> But our <hi>Author,</hi> who hath read over the Doctors Preface very carefully, can find no ſuch thing urged againſt the Diſſenters, and adds, <hi>All that Mr.</hi> Lobb <hi>founds this Accuſation on, is, That the</hi> Dean <hi>ſays, It is not improbable that the Jeſuits were the firſt ſetters up of Spiritual Prayer in</hi> England: And then goes on to a very decent Cenſure, ſaying, <hi>That this is mighty falſely and imperfectly repreſented.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir, If I had inſiſted on no more than what you here mention as the foundation of my Charge, I muſt acknowledg, that 'twould not only be imperfectly, but impertinently related: For what connexion is there between the <hi>Jeſuits Practiſes,</hi> and their <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is it not well known, that the Principles they profeſs, the Doctrines they embrace concerning many a point in Divinity, are one thing, even when their Practice is another? May they not then, in order to the carrying on a further Deſign, ſet on <hi>Practices</hi> contrary to their <hi>Doctrines?</hi> Yea, ſurely they may; and this is the whole Defence you make in behalf of the <hi>Dean,</hi> with which after an unneceſſary Harangue, you diſmiſs the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                  <p>But is this fair, to miſrepreſent an Adverſary, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute what needs no Confutation? Doth this redound to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>a Presbyter of the Church of</hi> England? Was this all on which Mr. <hi>Lobb founded his Accuſation?</hi> Did he not add ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more than what you relate? You ſay, all that Mr. <hi>Lobb</hi> founds this accuſation on is, that the Dean ſays, <hi>It is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the</hi> Jeſuits <hi>were the firſt ſetters up of</hi> Spiritual Prayer <hi>in</hi> England; <hi>which is mighty falſely and imperfectly repeſented.</hi> p. 6. Yet whoever will conſult the <hi>Enguiry</hi> will find, that I do out of the Dean add, <hi>That there is no improbality of the thing, if we conſider the Diſſenters pretences about Spiritual Prayer, to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61768:37"/>and Practice of the Jeſuits.</hi> The Dean ſuggeſts, that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Free Prayer, even that Spiritual and Free Prayer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which there is ſuch a Pother, is ſuited to the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the Jeſuits; to the Doctrine, that is, to their <hi>Principles.</hi> What dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is there between the Doctrine and the Principles of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England?</hi> In like manner I Query, What difference is there between the <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> of the Jeſuits? Doth the <hi>Dean</hi> then aſſert ſuch an Agreement to be between the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences</hi> of the Diſſenter about Spiritual Prayer, and the <hi>Doctrines</hi> or <hi>Principles</hi> of the Jeſuits, not only the Practices but <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the Jeſuits? Who then is the imperſect or miſtaken Repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dean's</hi> Charge againſt Diſſenters is, That the Diſſenters pretences about Spiritual Prayer, are ſuited with the Doctrines of the Jeſuits. And 'tis our concern to enquire after the truth of this Charge; I ſay of this charge; to wit, about the <hi>Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs</hi> that is between our <hi>Pretences</hi> and their <hi>Doctrines.</hi> For it is no way momentous to enquire after the practice of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Villains, who can transform themſelves into a thouſand ſhapes, whenever their Intereſt obliges them to do ſo. Was it never known that a Papiſt crept into ſome great Preferment in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> at which time they did both Aſſent and Conſent to the doctrines of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England?</hi> What think you of a <hi>quondam</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> to mention no more? did he not ſpeak well of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> yea even of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Religion? Is it therefore Popery?</p>
                  <p>For this Reafon it concerns me not to enquire after thoſe Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries inſiſted on by the Doctor, or to be found in that Pamphlet called <hi>Foxes and Firebrands.</hi> The great Enquiry muſt be after the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the Jeſuit, whether there is any ſuitableneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> pretences and the <hi>Jeſuits Doctrines.</hi> For which Reaſon the Jeſuits Writings were conſulted, and the Doctor's Charge found <hi>untrue;</hi> the Dr. being <hi>miſtaken</hi> as to <hi>matter of fact.</hi> He repreſented the Jeſuits Doctrines to be other than indeed they are, which, to ſpeak ſoftly, was a <hi>Miſtake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Deans Defender</hi> would have ſpoke to the purpoſe, He ſhould have ſearched thoſe places I inſiſted on in <hi>Azorius, Filiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and have ſhewed wherein I had either made a falſe report of their ſayings, or miſinterpreted 'em.

                  <p>There being nothing elſe of moment in the Reply to what I offered againſt the <hi>Dean</hi> about <hi>Spiritual Prayer,</hi> I might fairly, without ſaying any thing more, proceed to the next particular. But ſeeing ſome have ſpoken contemptibly of the <hi>Spirit of prayer,</hi> which is ſaid to aſſiſt ſuch as uſe <hi>free</hi> or <hi>extempore prayer,</hi> as if thoſe who ſpake of receiv'd help from the Spirit in prayer, were <hi>Enthuſiaſtical,</hi> &amp;c. and becauſe our Author talks as if the Jeſuits had the firſt hand in the <hi>Separation of the old Nonconformiſts from the Church of England,</hi> crying down the Common-prayers as a dull, formal, ſuperſtitious Worſhip, and the ſetting up <hi>free prayer</hi> in the room of it; I will ſhew,</p>

                  <p>This I cannot but conſider, as what doth very much reflect on the <hi>Diſpenſation of the Spirit,</hi> to the great diſhonour of true Chriſtian Religion. For ſuch is the preſent ſtate of <hi>true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that whoever ſpeaks contemptibly of the <hi>Spirits Aid,</hi> muſt be eſteemed not only a Deſpiſer of the firſt Reformers, but of that part of the preſent Conſtitution to which our <hi>Clergy</hi> on their entrance into their Function are <hi>principally concern'd.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Tis well known that what the firſt <hi>Reformers</hi> did in the Reforming the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> was by the <hi>Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons aſſembled in Parliament,</hi> recorded to have been done by the <hi>Aid of the Holy Ghost.</hi>

                  <p>The Parliament in K. <hi>Edward</hi>'s days paſſing an Act for the confirmation of the <hi>Publick Liturgy</hi> in the preamble thereof, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, <hi>That thoſe who drew up that Order of Divine Worſhip,</hi> did it by <hi>the Aid of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> 'Tis true this expreſſion could not eſcape the cenſure of ſuch as were Popiſhly affected; they
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61768:38"/>thinking it too much that it was ſaid, the Book was drawn by the <hi>aid of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as if the import of thoſe expreſſions had been nothing leſs than that thoſe <hi>perſons concern'd in the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it up,</hi> had been <hi>extraordinarily inſpir'd.</hi> But 'twas well anſwer'd by ſuch as ſaid, That it muſt not be <hi>ſo</hi> underſtood; that 'twas only to be taken in that ſenſe as <hi>all good motions and conſultations</hi> are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected or aſſiſted by the ſecret influences of Gods H. Spirit, which doth often help good men, even in their imperfect actions, where the good that is done is juſtly aſcrib'd to the grace of God. For this conſult that truly Judicious and Deſerving Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtory of the Reformation,</hi> Part 2. lib. 1. p. 94. The ſame that is ſaid of this expreſſion when applied to the firſt Compoſers of the Divine Service, may be ſaid of ſuch as are aſſiſted in <hi>free prayer</hi> by the <hi>ſecret Influences of the Holy Spirit.</hi> Moreover,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Clergy at their Ordinination</hi> were to receive the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt.</hi> In King <hi>Edward</hi>'s days, whenever a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> or <hi>Prieſt</hi> was Ordained, 'twas ſaid, <hi>Receive thou the Holy Ghoſt in the Name of the Father,</hi> &amp;c. But to what purpoſe, if not to <hi>aid</hi> and <hi>aſſiſt them</hi> in the diſcharge of their Miniſterial Function, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Prayer,</hi> in <hi>Preaching,</hi> in <hi>giving private Admenitions,</hi> and <hi>Exhortations?</hi> &amp;c. Hence I argue, The Spirit accordingly is given them, or not. If not, no wonder they reproach its work, and gracious Influences, to ſay no more? But if they do at their Ordination receive a plentiful portion of the Spirit, how can they talk ſo much againſt the <hi>Aſſiſtances</hi> thereof, vouchſafed to others? What, is it confin'd unto the Clergy only, or unto the Epiſcopal Clergy, that none without <hi>canting</hi> muſt mention One word of the Spirit? But</p>
                  <p n="3">3. 'Tis ſurprizing, that any of our Clergy ſhould ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing againſt the <hi>ſecret motions of Gods Spirit;</hi> for ſurely ſuch of them as are juſt, and true, and faithful to God, and their own ſouls, have <hi>actually felt</hi> ſo much of the <hi>Internal</hi> workings of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt on their ſouls,</hi> that they were thereby quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and moved to enter on the work of the Miniſtry. Thus 'tis with them, or at leaſt, they are conſcientiouſly perſwaded of as much; and can ſuch as have felt the power of the Holy Ghoſt on their own hearts, ſpeak evil of the Aſſiſtance it affords unto others? That the honeſt among the Epiſcopal Clergy are ſuch as know what <hi>'tis to be moved by the Holy Spirit,</hi> as they
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61768:39"/>themſelves truſt, is evident from the anſwer they give to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion propos'd to them, when they are preſented to Orders, which is, <hi>Do you truſt that you are inwardly moved by the Holy Ghoſt to take upon you this Office and Miniſtration to ſerve God for the promoting his glory, and for the edifying his people?</hi> To which the anſwer is, <hi>He truſts he is.</hi>

                  <p>It may be ſome may inquire, How comes it to paſs then that ſo many of the <hi>Clergy</hi> thus ordained, do not only neglect their own work, but by their <hi>uncomely diſcourſes</hi> reflect on this very ſpirit? To this no other anſwer but that of the <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> ſhall be given, who in his <hi>Hiſt. of the Reformation,</hi> Par. 2. l. p. 145. thus expreſſeth himſelf: <q>It has been oft lamented, that many come to receive Orders before they have ſeriouſly read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver theſe Queſtions, and examined themſelves whether they could with a good conſcience make the Anſwers there preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; ſince it is ſcarce credible that men of common honeſty would <hi>lye</hi> in the preſence of God on ſo great an occaſion; and yet 'tis too viſible, that many have not any ſuch inward voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor have ever conſidered ſeriouſly what it is. If it were well apprehended, that heat that many have to get into Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders would ſoon abate, who perhaps have nothing in their eye but ſome place of Profit, or Benefice, to which way muſt be made by that preceding Ceremony; and ſo enter into Orders as others are aſſociated into Fraternities and Corporations, with little previous ſenſe of that Holy Character they are to receive, when they thus dedicate their Lives and Labours to the Service of God in the Goſpel. In the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> the appreherſion of this made even good and holy men afraid to enter under ſuch bonds, and therefore they were often to be drag'd almoſt by force, or catcht at unawares, and be ſo ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated; as appears in the Lives of theſe two <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, <hi>Nazianzen</hi> and <hi>Chryſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And it had been happy for the Church if all thoſe that are autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riz'd to confer Orders, had ſtood on this more critically, and not been contented with a bare putting theſe Queſtions to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61768:39"/>thoſe who come to be Ordain'd, but had uſed a due ſtrictneſs before-hand, ſutable to that grave admonition of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy, Lay hands ſuddenly on no man, and be not partakers of other mens ſins.</hi>

                  <p>How would the Church have flouriſh'd if this worthy Drs. counſel had been both given and taken at the beginning of the Reformation! If all that entred on the Miniſtry had felt the mighty power of the Spirit in turning them from darkneſs to light, from the power of Satan unto God! How would they have labour'd for the converſion and edification of their hearers! The which work could not proſper in their hands, but ſuch as were born of God, receiving the Spirit, would have been ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by it to cry <hi>Abba Father. Spiritual</hi> and <hi>free prayer</hi> would have been from the beginning ſo <hi>well known,</hi> that the ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to have been <hi>Jeſuitical,</hi> would with the greateſt contempt and ſcorn be rejected; and thoſe many raſh and <hi>indecent epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetes</hi> given it, would have been conſider'd but as the overtacts of ill-will to the Reformation of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p n="2">§. II. The <hi>Account our Author gives of the firſt Separation,</hi> is very unrrue. For, 1. It was not the laying aſide All <hi>forms of prayer,</hi> that the old <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> preſt hard for. They were for the amending the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> but not for the removing all Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies. 'Tis true in K. <hi>Edward</hi>'s days there was a conteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Hooper</hi> and <hi>Ridley,</hi> &amp;c. about the old Popiſh Veſtments, but not about Forms of Prayer. In Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days at <hi>Franckfort</hi> there were great contentions among ſome of them, who before had uſed the <hi>Engliſh Liturgy,</hi> but not that thoſe who were againſt the uſe of the <hi>Engliſh Liturgy</hi> at that time, were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it as it was a <hi>Form of Prayer,</hi> but they apprehended that they being in foreign parts, they ſhould rather accommodate their worſhip to thoſe among whom they liv'd; whence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the <hi>Engliſh Liturgy,</hi> they uſed one near the <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Forms. Moreover in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, even long after the Separation, the old <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> declar'd, that they look'd on <hi>Forms of Prayer</hi> to be lawful. It may be they were griev'd to ſee Q. <hi>Elizabeths Biſhops</hi> to entertain more favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thoughts of the <hi>Pope</hi> than thoſe bleſſed <hi>Martyrs, Cranmer,</hi> and <hi>Rid<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61768:40"/>but againſt Forms they were not; or it may be they could not approve of any that would <hi>quench the motions of the Spirit</hi> they profeſſed to have felt before their <hi>Ordination,</hi> whether in truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto it for help in the exerciſe of Prayer, or any other parts of their work. But to cry down all <hi>Forms</hi> in order to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>free prayer</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and for this reaſon to ſeparate from the <hi>Church of England,</hi> is more than can be proved.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>great</hi> and <hi>principal</hi> reaſon of the <hi>Separation</hi> of the old <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> was occaſion'd by their preſſing towards that <hi>Reformation</hi> expreſly aim'd at by our <hi>Engliſh Reformers</hi> in <hi>H.</hi> 8.

's.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Henry 8th</hi>'s days, that wickedneſs that ſpread it ſelf throughout the Weſtern part of the World, ſadly prevail'd in theſe Northern parts. This part of the earth was in an eſpecial manner troubled with a vicious and ſenſual <hi>Clergy,</hi> whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample had a ſad influence on the <hi>Common people.</hi> The off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of a lewd vicious Clergy, was a profane and extremely wicked Laity; ſo that if ever, it might <hi>now</hi> be truly ſaid, <hi>The whole world lay in wickedneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This being the ſtate of the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laity,</hi> the fear of God and all true Religion almoſt loſt, it pleaſed the Father of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to open the eyes of ſome, to ſhew 'em the evil of the times, &amp;c. <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Calvin,</hi> and others beyond the ſeas, and <hi>Tindal, Frith, Barns,</hi> &amp;c. here in <hi>England.</hi> Theſe Worthies being deeply ſenſible of the Abominations of the times in which they liv'd, made diligent ſearch after the cauſes thereof, in order to the carrying on a Reformation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which enquiry, they found the <hi>viciouſneſs</hi> of the people to be occaſioned by the <hi>ſenſuality</hi> and <hi>lewdneſs</hi> of the <hi>Clergy;</hi> the <hi>lewdneſs</hi> of the <hi>Clergy</hi> to be the product of an <hi>uninſtituted Hierarchy,</hi> which was rather adjuſted for Worldly grandure than the glory of God.</p>
                  <p>The great cauſe of all thoſe Miſchiefs was the want of ſtrict and Scriptural Diſcipline, which (as it had <hi>not</hi> been in due exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe ſince the firſt degeneracy from the Apoſtolical Inſtitution and Primitive Practice, even ſo) could not be faithfully exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed

                  <p n="1">1. Mr. <hi>Tyndall,</hi> a bleſſed <hi>Martyr</hi> burnt at <hi>Brabant</hi> for his firm adhering to the <hi>Truths of the Goſpel,</hi> doth in thoſe Diſcourſes of his publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> ſhew, that the many Abominations of his Times proceeded from the viciouſneſs of a <hi>Proud, Covetous,</hi> &amp; <hi>Senſual Clergy,</hi> who having forſaken the <hi>Apoſtolical Rule,</hi> in proceſs of time through the Bounty of ſome wealthy perſons, who had embraced the Chriſtian Religion, and divers other ways, got an <hi>abundance of Riches,</hi> which occaſioned their <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Luxury,</hi> to the ruine of the true Religion: Thus in that Treatiſe of <hi>The Obedience of a Chriſtian man,</hi> 
                     <q>There is no Miſchiefs or Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (ſaith he) whether it be in the Temporal Regiment, or in the Spiritual, whereof they [i. e. <hi>The Spirituality, the Clergy</hi>] are not the chief Cauſes, and even the very Fountain and Spring, and as we ſay, the <hi>Well-head:</hi> So that 'tis impoſſible to Preach againſt Miſchief, except thou begin at <hi>them;</hi> or to ſet any Reformation in the world, except thou <hi>Reform them firſt.</hi>
                     </q> This ſame Mr. <hi>Tyndall</hi> in another place ſhews us, how they occaſioned ſo much miſchief, in theſe words, <q>But after that the Devil was broke looſe, and the <hi>Biſhops</hi> began to purchaſe, and the <hi>Deacons</hi> to ſcratch all to them, and the Spirituality to climb on high, then becauſe the <hi>Labour,</hi> [<hi>viz.</hi> of examining and confirming the Adult, who had been Baptized in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy] 'ſeemed too tedious and painful, they neglected it.</q> 
                     <hi>Tyndal</hi> of <hi>Sacraments and Ceremonies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Clergy</hi> growing rich, labour'd that their <hi>Honour</hi> might equalize their <hi>Wealth,</hi> which was followed with <hi>Idleneſs,</hi> a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of God and their Duty. Hence Preaching is let down, the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> being eſteem'd as the moſt effectual means of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. This occaſions the multiplication of ſignificant Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which was the great Reaſon of the dreadful <hi>Ignorance,</hi> into which the whole <hi>European</hi> world was plundg'd, when <hi>Popery</hi> prevail'd. So Mr. <hi>Tyndall,</hi> 
                     <q>I impute this our grievous fall into ſo extream and horrible Blindneſs (wherein we are ſo deep and ſo deadly brought aſleep) unto nothing ſo much, as unto the <hi>multitude of Ceremonies;</hi> for aſſoon as the <hi>Prelats</hi> had ſet
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61768:41"/>up ſuch a rabble of Ceremonies, they thought it ſuperfluous to teach the plain Text any longer, and the Law of God, Faith of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> foraſmuch as all ſuch things were <hi>play'd</hi> before the peoples faces daily in the Ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> Tyndall <hi>of the Ceremonies of the Maſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus 'tis evident, that in <hi>Henry</hi> the 8ths <hi>time</hi> the great wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs of that Age was grievous to ſuch as aim'd at <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> that theſe wickedneſſes were occaſion'd by the Pride, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, and Senſuality of the rich Clergy. But</p>
                  <p n="2">2. 'Tis as manifeſt, That the <hi>Pride</hi> of the Clergy was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by their <hi>Prelacy,</hi> their aſpiring after a <hi>Dominoon</hi> over their <hi>Brethren.</hi> Whence the One gets the name of <hi>Biſhop</hi> appropriated unto him, and with that name an <hi>Unaccountable,</hi> yea an <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural Power.</hi> So Mr. <hi>Tyndall</hi> in his <hi>Practice of Prelates;</hi> 
                     <q>The Office of a Biſhop was a roume at the beginning that no man coveted, and that no man durſt take upon him, ſave he that loved Jeſus Chriſt better than his own Life. For as Chriſt ſaith, That no man might be his Diſciple, except that he were ready to forſake Life, and all: Even ſo might that Officer be ſure, that it might coſt him his Life at one time or another, for bearing record unto the Truth. But after that the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Chriſtians were encreaſed, and many great men had received the Faith, then both Lands and Rents, as well as other Goods, were given unto the maintenance as well of the Clergy, as of the Poor; becauſe they gave then no Tythes to the Prieſts, nor yet now do, ſave in certain Countries. For it is too much to give Alms, Offerings, Lands, and Tythes alſo. And then <hi>the Biſhops made them Subſtitutes under them to help them, which they called Prieſts, and kept the name of Biſhops to themſelves.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But out of the <hi>Deacons</hi> ſprang all the <hi>Miſchief.</hi> For through their hands went all things, they miniſtred unto the Clergy, they miniſtred unto the Poor, they were in favour with great and ſmall. And when the <hi>Biſhops Office began to have reſt and be Honourable,</hi> then the <hi>Deacons</hi> through Favour and Gifts climbed up thereunto, as lightly as he that hath the old <hi>Abbots Treaſure ſucceedeth with us.</hi> And by the means of their practice and acquaintance in the world, they were more ſubtle and worldly wiſe than the old Biſhops, and leſs learned in Gods word, as our

                        <hi>Prelates</hi> are, when they come from Stewardſhips in Gentlemens Houſes, and from ſurveying of great mens Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> —Then, while they that had the Plow by the tail, looked back, the <hi>Plow went awry, Faith waxed feeble and faint, Love waxed cold, the Scripture waxed dark, Chriſt was no more ſeen;</hi> He was in the Mount with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Biſhops</hi> would have a <hi>God upon the earth,</hi> whom they might ſee; and thereupon they began to diſpute who ſhould be greateſt.</q> So far Mr. <hi>Tyndal</hi> in his <hi>Practice of Popiſh Prelates.</hi>

                        <hi>Cathedral Church,</hi> and the Countrey about it as <hi>Suburbs</hi> unto it. Methought this was far-fetcht, but I durſt not deny it, becauſe it was ſo great Authority, and of ſo holy a <hi>Father,</hi> and of ſo great a Divine. But this I dare ſay, that his Holineſs could never prove it by Scripture, nor yet by any <hi>Authority of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,</hi> nor yet by any practiſe of the Apoſtles; and yet it muſt be true, becauſe a <hi>Pillar of the Church hath ſpoken it.</hi> But let us ſee what the <hi>Doctors</hi> ſay to mine Article. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> doth declare this Text of the Apoſtle, <hi>I have left thee behind,</hi> &amp;c. He would not commit unto one <hi>Biſhop</hi> a whole Ylde, but he did injoyn that every <hi>City</hi> ſhould have his <hi>proper Paſtor,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that by this means they ſhould more diligently <hi>overſee</hi> the people, and alſo that the labour ſhould be more eaſie to bear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alſo <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> on that ſame Text: He would not that a whole Countrey ſhould be permitted unto one man, but he enjoined to every man his Cure, by that means he knew that his labour ſhould be more eaſie, and the ſubjects ſhould be with more diligence govern'd, if the Teachers were not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract with the governing of many Churches, but had cure and charge of <hi>one Church only,</hi> &amp;c. Methinks theſe be plain words, and able to move a man to ſpeak as much as I did. But grant that you may have all theſe Cities, yet can you make it none <hi>Hereſie.</hi> For my Lord <hi>Cardinal</hi> granted that it was but <hi>againſt him,</hi> and againſt <hi>you,</hi> which be no <hi>Gods.</hi> But I poor man muſt be an Heretick, there is no remedy, You will have it ſo, and who is able to ſay nay? <hi>Not all Scripture,</hi> nor yet <hi>God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>

And then were we troubled and commanded to your Courts from day to day, for not coming to your Pariſh-Churches.

                  <p>HIS Reply to what I offer'd to the <hi>Dean</hi>'s ſecond Argument, falls now under Conſideration.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dean</hi> in repreſenting the Diſſenter, to the great Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Party, inſinuates as if their oppoſing <hi>Prelatical</hi> Epiſcopacy, had been the moſt effectual way to caſt reproach on the firſt <hi>Reformers,</hi> and to introduce <hi>Popery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Anſwer unto this I did <hi>Firſt</hi> prove, 1. That it was not the Principle nor the Intereſt of the Jeſuit to deſtroy Epiſcopacy. A Truth the Dean's Subſtitute doth not deny. 2. That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the firſt Reformation is not in the leaſt blaſted by the Diſſenter, which I evinc'd with ſo much Demonſtration, that the whole that is returned by way of <hi>Anſwer,</hi> is, His not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſome of thoſe perſons, on whoſe Teſtimony I inſiſted, (though he gives no Reaſon for his Unbelief.) His proving what I granted, and his Extravagant Interpreting an Argument brought to evince, <hi>That 'twas not the Jeſuits Intereſt to deſtroy a Prelatical Epiſcopal Conſtitution, to be an admirable Addreſs to the Lords and Commons, to pull down Biſhops, and divide their Lands.</hi> All which is done partly in his <hi>Preface,</hi> and partly in the firſt Chapter of his great Book, to ſhew himſelf an excellent <hi>Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſt.</hi> But the whole is ſo little to the purpoſe, that if he had not given an occaſion to enlighten the <hi>Reader</hi> concerning ſome momentous Inſtances, I would have paſs'd it by as deſerving no farther Conſideration.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Every thing is ſaid to be Miſrepreſented. But how the Doctor's own words ſhould miſrepreſent his own ſenſe, is not
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61768:46"/>overeaſie to apprehend. However, Whether there be any Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>report, I'll leave it to the Impartial <hi>Reader,</hi> and conſider what Reply is made to what I offer'd in Anſwer to the Doctor's <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely Accuſation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. He grants, [<hi>p.</hi> 38.] That the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do not ſo much <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Malign the Epiſcopal</hi> Government. Neither is it their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple nor Intereſt to deſtroy it. Why then ſhould they be brought to act ſo contrary to their Principle and Intereſt, as to deſtroy what they ſo much endeavour to preſerve, ſtrengthen and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh? But</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He adds, Though they are for <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> yet they may deſign the deſtruction of a <hi>Proteſtant Epiſcopacy, &amp;c.</hi> Reply. I ſaid, That 'twas not the <hi>Deſtruction of Epiſcopacy,</hi> but the <hi>poſſeſſing themſelves of our Biſhopricks, that they would be at,</hi> which may be without any alteration of the Epiſcopal Conſtitution, ſo far as 'tis Epiſcopal.</p>
                  <p>His running then unto <hi>France</hi> is nothing to the purpoſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it may be looked on as an intimation of his good will to the <hi>Arbitrary</hi> proceedings of that Country.</p>
                  <p>However, I'le deſire our Author to conſider, That <hi>a change of Perſons without any alteration of the Epiſcopal Conſtitution,</hi> may moſt effectually anſwer the end of <hi>the Jeſuit.</hi> For hereby they would be capacitated (if ever a <hi>Popiſh Prince</hi> ſhould come to the Crown) to argue with the common people concerning <hi>the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs of a ſeparating from Rome,</hi> from the ſame <hi>Topicks</hi> with the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For this reaſon I cannot but be pretty confident that the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits</hi> acting according to their <hi>own Principles</hi> and <hi>Intereſt,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

'tis eaſie to demonſtrate that the begun Reformation in King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the <hi>6ths</hi> days was more excellent than the Preſent; and that inſtead of carrying on the Reformation, it hath been
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61768:47"/>carried back, to the great grief of ſound Proteſtants.</p>
                  <p>This hath been in part prov'd, when I did ſhew the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to favour <hi>Popery,</hi> out of Dr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> two Sons of the Church; though I fear the mentioning of the latter in Conjunction with the former, may not be ſo meet; the former being a through <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> a man of great Worth; but the heart of the latter towards <hi>Rome;</hi> for which reaſon, as their <hi>Principles</hi> are vaſtly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, ſo ſhould they be kept at a diſtance by me, if <hi>Heylin</hi> had not acknowledged that to be a <hi>truth,</hi> which I rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, becauſe found in the <hi>incomparable Dr. Burnet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He now take notice of another conſiderable difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the very Conſtitution of <hi>Epiſcopacy in King Edward</hi> the 6th's time, and that in <hi>Queen Elizabeths:</hi> The <hi>former</hi> was ſuch as was inconſiſtent with the <hi>Popes Supremacy;</hi> for they were to hold all <hi>their Courts in the Kings Name;</hi> but the <hi>latter,</hi> ſuch as is moſt eaſily reduc'd to the <hi>exalting the Court of Rome.</hi> The Government of the Church being taken from the <hi>Prince,</hi> 'tis not ſo difficult to fix it on the <hi>Pope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus there is a difference between King <hi>Edwards,</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeths Epiſcopacies.</hi> I may alſo add,</p>
                  <p>That there is a great difference between the <hi>preſent</hi> Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and that in Queen <hi>Elizabeths,</hi> if we may believe the Lord <hi>Treaſurer Cecil,</hi> who ſuggeſts, that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> did not look on their <hi>Superiority</hi> above their Brethren, to be of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> as the <hi>Dean of Pauls,</hi> and his Subſtitute now do: For this I will give you an account we have of the Speeches uſed in the <hi>Parliament</hi> by Sir <hi>Francis Knolles,</hi> and after Written to my Lord <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> Sir <hi>William Cecil,</hi> as I find it in the end of the <hi>Aſſertion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>To the end I may inform your Lordſhip of my dealing in this <hi>Parliament-time,</hi> againſt the undue claimed <hi>Superiority of the Biſhops</hi> over their <hi>Inferior Brethren:</hi>
                     </q> Thus it was,</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Becauſe I was in the Parliament-time, in the 25th year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, in which time, firſt all the Clergy, as well Biſhops as others, made an humble Submiſſion to King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, acknowledging his Supremacy, and deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Uſurpation of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome's</hi> Authority: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Submiſſion of the Clergy, the King gave unto
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61768:47"/>the ſaid Biſhops the ſame ample Rule, that before they had under the Pope, over their Inferior Brethren; ſaving that the ſame Rule was abridg'd by Statute, by this Parenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis following, that is to ſay (without offending the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Royal of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and the Laws and Cuſtoms of the Realm): in the latter end of the Statute it was added, That whoſoever offendeth in any one part of that Statute, and their Aiders, Counſellers, and Abetters, they did all fall into the penalty of the Praemunire. And after I had recited this Statute in the Parliament-Houſe, I declared, that in King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th's days, after this, there was no Biſhop that did practiſe Superiority over the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Brethren. And in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s days the ſaid Biſhops obtained a Statute, whereby they were Authorized to keep their Courts in the Kings Name: the which Statute was repealed in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days, and was not revived in her Majeſties time that now is; whereupon it was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me, by what Authority the Biſhops do keep their Courts now in their own Names, becauſe it is againſt the Prerogative Royal of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> that any ſhould keep a Court without ſufficient Warrant from the Crown: Whereupon I was anſwered, that the Biſhops do keep their Courts now by Preſcriptions; and it is true, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops may Preſcribe, that King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th gave them Authority by the Statute of the 25th of his Reign, to have Authority and Rule over their Inferior Brethren, as ample as they had in the Popes time: For this was no ſpecial Warrant for them to keep their Courts by, and that in their own Names. And yet they have none other War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to keep their Courts (as they do now in their own Names) to my knowledg. And this was the Cauſe that made them obtain a Statute in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s days, to keep their Courts by, in the Kings Name. Now it is a ſtrange Allegation, that the Biſhops ſhould claim Authority at this preſent, to keep their Courts in their own Names (as they do) by Preſcription, becauſe the Statute of 25. doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them generally from offending of the Prerogative Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and the Laws and Cuſtoms of the Realm. And no man may juſtly keep a Court with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61768:48"/>out a ſpecial Warrant from the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid. And the general Liberty given by King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th to the Biſhops, to Rule and Govern as they did in the Popes time, is no ſufficient Warrant to the Biſhops, to keep their own Courts in their own Names by Preſcription, as I take it: And therefore the Biſhops had done wiſely, if they had ſought a Warrant by Statute, to keep their Courts in the Queens Name, as the Biſhops did in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s days: in which time Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> did cauſe <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> and <hi>Bucer</hi> to come over into this Realm, to be placed in the Two Univerſities, for the better Inſtruction of the Univerſities in the Word of God. And Biſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> did humbly prefer theſe Learned men without any challenge to himſelf of any Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Rule in this behalf, over his Inferior Brethren. And the time hath been, that no man could carry away any Grant from the Crown of <hi>England</hi> by general words, but that he muſt have ſpecial words to carry the ſame by: Therefore now the Biſhops are Warranted to carry away the keeping of their Courts in their own Names, by Preſcription, it paſſeth my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Moreover, whereas your Lordſhip ſaid unto me, <hi>that the Biſhops have forſaken their claim of Superiority over their inferior Brethren</hi> (lately), <hi>to be by Gods Ordinance,</hi> and that <hi>now they do only claim Superiority from her Majeſties Supreme Government.</hi> If this be true, then 'tis requiſite, and neceſſary, that my Lord of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> that now is, do recant, and retract his ſaying in his Book of the great Volume againſt <hi>Cartwright,</hi> where he ſaith in plain words (by the name of Dr. <hi>Whitgift</hi>), that the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of Biſhops is Gods own Inſtitution: which ſaying doth impugn her Majeſties Supreme Government directly; and therefore it is to be retracted plainly and truly. For Chriſt truly and plainly confeſſes, <hi>John</hi> 18.36. That his Kingdom was not of this world; and therefore he gave no worldy Rule or Preheminence to his Apoſtles, but the Heavenly Rule, which was to Preach the Goſpel, ſaying, <hi>Ite, praedicate in omnem mundum; Quicunque crediderit &amp; baptizatus fuerit, ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus erit: qui non crediderit, condemnabitur: Go and Preach in all the world, whoſoever ſhall believe and be baptized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that will not believe, ſhall be condemned,</hi> Mar. 16.16.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61768:48"/>But the Biſhops do cry out, ſaying, That <hi>Cartwright</hi> and his Fellows would have no Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So belike the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops care for no Government, but for worldly and forcible Government over their Brethren, the which Chriſt never gave to his Diſciples nor Apoſtles, but made them ſubject to the Rule of Princes, who ought not to be reſiſted, ſaving that they might anſwer unto Princes, that they muſt rather obey God than men, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.29. And yet in no wiſe to reſiſt the Prince, but to take up the Croſs and follow Chriſt.</q> So far Sir <hi>Francis Knolles</hi> Diſcourſe in <hi>Parliament</hi> concerning the <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But to return: I would fain know, why we may not think <hi>honourably of good beginnings,</hi> even when we cannot approve of ſuch as put a ſtop thereunto? Is the <hi>Epiſcopacy of King</hi> Edward ſo much the ſame in all reſpects with the preſent, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſſents from this, muſt thereby caſt a reproach on that? Surely the <hi>Dean</hi> won't ſay ſo, after ſo many Months conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. There is an <hi>admirable diſtinction</hi> inſiſted on, which will bring off the <hi>Dean</hi> without all doubt, <hi>viz.</hi> There is a <hi>Popiſh</hi> and a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Epiſcopacy: But where lies the Difference? What Difference is there between our preſent Epiſcopacy, and that in <hi>Henry</hi> the 8ths time?</p>
                  <p>Is not the <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> ſo far as 'tis an Epiſcopacy, the ſame? What is there <hi>Intrinſecal</hi> to this Epiſcopal Conſtitution, that differs from <hi>that?</hi> Whence if that be <hi>Popiſh,</hi> why may not this, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'tis the ſame with that, be in like manner <hi>ſo?</hi> That <hi>Henry</hi> the 8ths <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> was <hi>Popiſh,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Bramhall</hi> hath evinced, in proving, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> begun the Separation from <hi>Rome.</hi> In fine, Let our Author tell me the <hi>Difference</hi> between Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Epiſcopacy</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeths Epiſcopacy</hi> on her firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the Throne. Is not the Epiſcopacy now the ſame with that at the Reforming the Liturgy by Act of Parliament? and was not that Epiſcopacy the ſame with Queen <hi>Maries?</hi> The <hi>only ſpecifying Difference</hi> that can be ſuggeſted is, that though the <hi>Epiſcopacy as ſuch,</hi> is the <hi>ſame,</hi> and the <hi>Perſons</hi> in both may be the <hi>ſame,</hi> yea and their <hi>Principles,</hi> for ſo it hath been in King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th, Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> yet the <hi>outward profeſſion</hi> of the Biſhops is not the ſame. But is this <hi>Extrinſecal Conſideration</hi> ſufficient to occaſion
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61768:49"/>a Difference that is <hi>Intrinſecal?</hi> Moreover, to return to his <hi>French Monarch;</hi> Hath not the Experience of many a year aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured us, That when <hi>Monarchs</hi> deſign not the enlarging their own <hi>Monarchies,</hi> they have done all they could to preſerve <hi>other</hi> Monarchies? An <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> or a <hi>Democracy,</hi> being things deteſtable in their eye.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. His anſwering the Letter of the Council by tranſcribing part of Sir <hi>Francis Walſingham</hi>'s Letter, as recorded in Dr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> bing little to the purpoſe, might have eſcaped my Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, had it not been very neceſſary to ſuggeſt, <hi>How pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently</hi> he overlook'd the great Principles on which the Queen grounded her proceedings; the one being, <hi>That Conſciences can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be forced, but to be won and reduced by force of Truth, with the aid of time, and uſe of all good means of Inſtruction, and Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> A Principle unto which if our Clergy would adhere, it might have conduced very much to the Peace of the <hi>Church.</hi> This I ſuppoſe is a ſufficient Reply to the <hi>Dean</hi>'s Subſtitute.</p>

                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:61768:49"/>
                  <p>The other part of his Reply is as little to the purpoſe, unleſs a declaiming againſt <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Arguments, ſuch as are too ſtrong to receive an Anſwer, be the moſt effectual way to ruine <hi>Popery.</hi> 'Tis true, we reject the <hi>Popiſh</hi> pretences about <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> as <hi>futilous;</hi> many <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (in the number of which ſome Nonconformiſts may be liſted) having unanſwerably proved <hi>Popery to be a Novelty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, If Popery or Epiſcopacy be not agreeable to the Scriptures, whatever their pretences are to <hi>Antiquity,</hi> they will be found unworthy the conſideration of a ſolid Divine; and therefore becauſe he ſends me to Biſhop <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

The Truth of God</hi> (ſaith the Biſhop) <hi>is neither further'd by the Face of</hi> Antiquity, <hi>nor hinder'd by the Opinion of</hi> Novelty. <hi>For oftentimes the thing that is</hi> New <hi>is condemned as</hi> Old; <hi>and the thing that is indeed</hi> Old <hi>is condemned as</hi> New. <hi>If</hi> Newneſs <hi>in Religion, in all reſpects, and every way, were ill, Chriſt would not have reſembled his Doctrine to</hi> New Wine, <hi>&amp;c.

The great Enquiry then muſt be after the <hi>Faulty Divider, Whether the Conformiſt, or the Nonconformiſt be the Divider?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſtate of the Caſe was given in the <hi>Enquiry,</hi> [p. 23.] where the Principle on which the Diſſenters proceed was laid down, and improv'd; this ſhould have been conſider'd by our <hi>Author,</hi> but he was ſo prudent as to paſs it by: For which Reaſon, without any Reflections on my Learned Adverſary, I muſt mind him of the <hi>ſtate of the Controverſie,</hi> and ſhew wherein he hath exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed his Wiſdom in leaping over what he could not handſomly remove out of the way.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Enquiry after the Faulty Divider,</hi> I ſhewed wherein the Parties at variance agreed, and wherein they differ'd. 1. They agreed in thoſe Points commonly called <hi>Docirinal</hi> or <hi>Subſtantial,</hi> in contradiſtinction to <hi>leſſer things,</hi> about <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Church-Diſcipline,</hi> &amp;c. They differ'd about what was in the Judgment of the Diſſenter <hi>Sinful;</hi> but in the Opinion of the Epiſcopal, only <hi>Indifferent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true, the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> repreſent us as a weak People, whoſe Conſciences as to thoſe particulars are <hi>Erreneous;</hi> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt caſt off theſe erring Conſciences, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Reply</hi> is, We ſeek Heaven for Counſel, we ſtudy hard for the Truth, read with the greateſt Impartiality and Freedom the Diſcourſes the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> have written; For we can ſolemnly and with much ſincerity declare, as in the preſence of an Heart-ſearching God, We would with the greateſt chearfulneſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to all the <hi>Impoſitions,</hi> if we thought we could do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin. That we are ſo <hi>peeviſh</hi> as to loſe the Comforts of a good Benefice, merely to gratifie an obſtinate Humour; if we are in danger of being biaſs'd one way more than another by
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61768:50"/>carnal conſiderations, 'tis <hi>towards Conformity.</hi> For if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, we are freed from the reproaches and contempt of many, from the continued fear of Impriſonment, and other uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſeverities, and in a fair way of abounding with the good things of this life for the ſupporting our ſelves and Families. But if we conform not, we are repreſented as <hi>Factious</hi> and <hi>Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> expos'd to the Rage of every vile <hi>Informer,</hi> in conſtant dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Fines, &amp;c. and of more miſeries than I can with delight reherſe.</p>
                  <p>However, though there are conſiderations enough from the world to byas our minds, in a ſeeking for the Truth, to lean to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Conformity;</hi> yet deſiring to approve our ſelves ſincere to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, we find, <hi>That we cannot without ſin conform;</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without ſinning deliberately, and knowingly comply with the <hi>Epiſcopal Impoſitions;</hi> and if we ſhould notwithſtanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to live and die Conformiſts, we ſhould knowingly, and deliberately ſin, yea, and die under the <hi>guilt</hi> thereof, which is a thing ſo hazardous to the ſoul, that we durſt not touch with Conformity, leſt we die, leſt we die eternally.</p>
                  <p>We cenſure not ſuch as do <hi>conform,</hi> becauſe they not lying under the <hi>ſame convictions</hi> of Conſcience as we do, may not by their Conformity run that hazard, which we unavoidably muſt, ſhould we againſt the <hi>light of our Conſciences</hi> comply. There is a great difference between thoſe that act according to the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of their Conſciences, and ſuch as act contrary thereunto: For which reaſon I wonder, that our great <hi>Church-men</hi> ſhould ſay, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> repreſented all <hi>Conformiſts</hi> as a company of <hi>Perjured Villains,</hi> meerly becauſe he ſhew'd, that if the Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts ſhould contrary to the Dictates of their Conſcience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, they ſhould be guilty of <hi>Perjury,</hi> and ſeveral other great ſins.</p>
                  <p>But though this be the truth, yet there are ſome who will not believe it, who ſay we, do we what we can for their ſatisfaction, will count us a <hi>pack of Hypocrites.</hi> For which reaſon, that I might anticipate the cenſure, I laid down the <hi>Principle</hi> unto which Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters do moſt firmly adhere, the diſcuſſing which is what they do moſt ſincerely deſire.</p>
                  <p>The Principle is this, <hi>That the word of God contained in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is the</hi> only <hi>Rule of the Whole, and of every part of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:61768:51"/>As for <hi>external circumſtances,</hi> as time and place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being no part of, though neceſſary appendages unto our Religion.</p>
                  <p>From this <hi>Principle</hi> I proceed to this Concluſion, <hi>That whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver part of the Service of the Church of</hi> England <hi>is impos'd on us, as ſo neceſſary a part of our Religion, as to be a term of Communion, if not agreeable to the word of God in Scripture, that Impoſition is ſinful.</hi>

                  <p>Our Adverſary conſiders, that ſuch as live in <hi>England,</hi> and yet are not of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> do not belong unto the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church; that is, they are all in a ſtate of damnation. Hence 'tis we muſt, according unto him, be a member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or be damned. We are willing with all our hearts to be members of the ſame Church with them, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be members of the Catholick Church is what we deſire. But this, ſay they, we cannot be, but by complying with their impoſed <hi>terms.</hi> To which we reply, Let their terms be as Catholick as they pretend their Church is, and we'l comply: <hi>i. e.</hi> Let them keep to a <hi>few, certain,</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> things; let them not impoſe as terms of Union, any thing but what is according to the <hi>Word</hi> of God in Scripture, we are ſatisfied, the Controverſie is at an end. But if they will take on 'em to make that a <hi>part of true Religion,</hi> yea ſo <hi>neceſſary a part,</hi> as to <hi>make it a term of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Catholick Church,</hi> 'tis a ſinful encroachment on the Prerogative of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, with which we dare not compl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61768:51"/>fleſh, and the like, found in Scripture; and becauſe not found in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, therefore to be rejected. To which,</hi> ſaith the Jeſuit, <hi>anſwer thus: Ask where 'tis forbidden in Scripture? if not forbidden in Scripture, 'tis no ſin to obſerve 'em; for where there is no Law, there is no tranſgreſſion.</hi> So far <hi>Coſterus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To whom we rejoyn, <hi>That the holy Scriptures being the</hi> only <hi>Rule of the Whole, and of Every part of true Religion,</hi> if theſe things be not according to the Scripture, 'tis becauſe there is no truth in 'em. There muſt be an exact correſpondency and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeableneſs between the Rule and its Regulate. The Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late muſt be brought to the Rule, and if it doth not agree with it, 'tis becauſe the Regulate is not Right. The word of God in Scripture is the Rule, what Religion ſoever varies from the Rule, 'tis a falſe Religion. <hi>Rectum eſt Index ſui &amp; obliqui.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are ſome Religions are larger than the Rule. There are other Religions that fall ſhort of the Rule. They who embrace any Notion as a part of their Religion, which is not to be found in Scripture, is too large for the Scripture; and ſuch as reject what the Scripture injoins, have a Religion too ſhort. The one puts the Scripture on the Rack, to ſtretch it to their Religion; but the other pares off a conſiderable part of Scripture, that the Rule may not exceed their Religion. But ſuch as keep exactly to the word of God in Scripture, who neither go beyond, nor fall ſhort of it, are in the right.</p>
                  <p>To make that a part of our Religion which is not to be found in Scripture, is to take that for a part of our Religion which God hath not made a part thereof, which is ſinful. How much more ſo is the making it a term of communion?</p>
                  <p>That the things in controverſie between the Church and the Diſſenter, are not to be found in Scripture, and conſequently are no part of true Religion, is evident, not only becauſe we can't underſtand where 'tis to be found, nor becauſe the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men cannot direct us where to find it; but becauſe they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves look on 'em as indifferent, <hi>i. e.</hi> as what is not injoin'd us in the word of God, <hi>q. d.</hi> as what is not according to the word of God.</p>
                  <p>All this being moſt plain and obvious to an ordinary Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city that is not biaſſed by Prejudice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let the world judge who is in the <hi>FAULT,</hi> They who keep cloſe to Scripture, or
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61768:52"/>they who recede therefrom. They who will do any thing, but Sin, for Peace; Or they who will exerciſe their Authority, and impoſe unneceſſary things with the greateſt Violence imaginable: I ſay, with the greateſt Violence imaginable; for they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd with ſuch a ſevere Threatning anrex'd, that whoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes a compliance, is cut off from the Catholick <hi>Church,</hi> and given over to the Devil. Hence 'tis, that they impoſing Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things as neceſſary to Salvation, do according to Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet's</hi> own Rule, declare themſelves to be the <hi>Schiſmatical Dividers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay, according to Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet's</hi> own <hi>Rule,</hi> compar'd with his <hi>Subſtitutes Notion.</hi> In the Doctor's <hi>Unreaſonableneſs of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> p. 213. he ſaith, That <hi>there are three</hi> Caſes <hi>wheren the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture allow of Separation.</hi> The <hi>laſt</hi> of which is, <hi>When men make things Indifferent</hi> Neceſſary <hi>to Salvation, and divide the Church upon that account; and this was the Caſe of the falſe Apoſtles, who urged the Ceremonies of the Law, as neceſſary to Salvation.—Now although St.</hi> Paul <hi>himſelf complied ſometimes with the practice of them. — Yet when theſe falſe Apoſtles came to enforce the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of them as neceſſary to Salvation,</hi> then he bids the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans at <hi>Philippi</hi> to beware of them; i. e. <hi>To fly their Communion, and have nothing to do with chem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From this Rule of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> it muſt follow, That if the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> make things <hi>Indifferent Neceſſary to Salvation,</hi> our Separation from the <hi>Church</hi> is allowed by the Scriptures; yea commanded and enjoyned. We muſt beware of 'em, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> to fly their Communnion, and have nothing to do with them. But that things Indifferent are made neceſſary by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> according to his Doctrine, doth appear irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragably.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That which is Neceſſary to our Communion with the</hi> Catholick <hi>Church, is, according to his Doctrine, neceſſary to Salvation. But</hi> Indifferent things <hi>are Neceſſary to our</hi> Communion <hi>with the Church of</hi> England, <hi>which is One with the Communion with the Catholick Church, in that, according to him, they are made neceſſary to our</hi> Communion <hi>with the Church of</hi> England, <hi>which is One with the Communion with the Catholique Church,</hi> according to his conſtant Judgment. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or in other Terms, Whatever is made neceſſary to our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61768:52"/>Members of the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> is made neceſſary to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; for to be Members of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and to be in a ſtate of Salvation, is the ſame; and to be Members of the particular <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and Members of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> is one and the ſame with our Author, [<hi>p.</hi> 248.] As if it had been ſaid, To be Members of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> is to be in a ſtate of Salvation; but not to be Members of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> is to be out of a ſtate of Salvation. Whence what is made neceſſary to our being Members of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> is made neceſſary to our Salvation; that is, <hi>The many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Ceremonies impos'd, as terms of our Communion with the Church of</hi> England, <hi>are made neceſſary for Salvation,</hi> according to our Author.</p>
                  <p>For which reaſon <hi>the Scripture</hi> allows our Separation, yea the Scripture bids us beware of her, that is, to fly her Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and have nothing to do with her. Thus the <hi>Doctor</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with his <hi>Subſtitute</hi> furniſhes us with an unanſwerable Argument to clear the Diſſenter from the odious Sin of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> which in ſhort is this;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From ſuch as make Indifferent things Neceſſary to Salvation, we muſt Separate.</hi> This is Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the Church of</hi> England <hi>makes Indifferent things neceſſary to Salvation.</hi> This is the Dr's Subſtitutes Notion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> We may, yea we muſt Separate; that is, 'Tis the Will of God we ſhould Separate, or 'tis our Duty, and therefore not our Sin to ſeparate; <hi>(i. e.)</hi> We are not the <hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is <hi>Argumentum ad Hominem;</hi> and either this Author muſt quit his Doctrine, or acquit us of <hi>Schiſme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to treat our Author with the greater Civility, we'll ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him to be ſo tenacious of his own Doctrine, that he'll ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcharge us of <hi>Schiſme</hi> than abandon his beloved Notions; for which reaſon, ſeeing 'tis on all ſides acknowledged that there is a Faulty Diviſion among us, and conſequently a <hi>Faulty Divider,</hi> who is the <hi>Schiſmatick;</hi> He muſt be either the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or the Conformiſt; but not the <hi>Diſſenter,</hi> as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready prov'd from our Author's own <hi>Topicks; Ergo,</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt. Here we might have put an end to this Diſcourſe, and would do ſo, had not our Author's fertil Brain furniſh'd us with another Argument, that doth as fully evince the <hi>Conformiſt</hi>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:61768:53"/>to be the <hi>Schiſmatick,</hi> as the former clear'd the <hi>Diſſenter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the management of this Argument, we'll conſider the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of</hi> Dr. <hi>Peter Gunning</hi> and <hi>Peirſon,</hi> as compared with our Author.</p>
                  <p>The I earned <hi>G.</hi> and <hi>P.</hi> in <hi>a Conference with the Papiſts,</hi> aſſert, <hi>That a Superiours unjuſt caſting any out of the Church, is Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</hi> If the Governours of the <hi>Church</hi> do by ſinful Impoſitions, or unjuſt Excommunications caſt any out of the <hi>Church,</hi> they are <hi>Schiſmatical.</hi> This our <hi>Author</hi> won't deny.</p>
                  <p>But according to his Notion, The <hi>Church of</hi> England are guilty of <hi>ſuch Impoſitions,</hi> and do <hi>unjuſtly Excommunicate Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Impoſitions</hi> are <hi>ſinful</hi> is evident, in that Indifferent things (as has been prov'd) are made neceſſary to Salvation. The making any indifferent thing Neceſſary to Salvation, is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. But the impoſing indifferent things as terms of <hi>Catholique</hi> Communion, is the making ſuch things Neceſſary to Salvation. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Sinful. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Impoſer is Schiſmatical. But</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whoever doth unjuſtly Excommunicate any, are Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical. This is Dr. <hi>Gunning</hi>'s ſenſe. But the <hi>Church of</hi> England (if they agree with our Author) Excommunicates the Diſſenter <hi>unjuſtly. Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> Excommunicates unjuſtly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrine of our Author, is demonſtrable; even in that the <hi>Church</hi> doth, as he would have it, by Excommunication caſt thouſands out of a ſtate of Salvation, for not complying with little uncommanded things. Whence I argue thus, To Excommunicate, or caſt us out of a ſtate of Salvation, merely becauſe we cannot comply with what God never commanded us, is to Excommunicate unjuſtly: But ſo doth the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> if we may paſs a cenſure on her as our Author pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes us to do; for the <hi>Church</hi> according unto him doth Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, that is, ſhut Heaven-gates againſt ſuch to whom our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath promiſed the opening them.</p>
                  <p>To illuſtrate this with the greater clearneſs, I beſeech the <hi>Reader</hi> to conſider, That Salvation is promiſed by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> unto all ſuch as do ſincerely Believe, truly Repent, and lead an Holy Life in all Godlineſs and Honeſty. Though a man may be daily guilty of leſſer Evils, yet if he believe in <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:61768:53"/>and renders ſincere Obedience to the known Will of God, he ſhall be ſaved. All which may be, even with thoſe, who being verily perſwaded that their compliances with the preſent Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions are ſinful, durſt not Conform; that is, <hi>The Promiſe of Salvation is made by Chriſt to many, who do not conform to the Imp<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſitions of the Church of</hi> England. But Salvation by our <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> is denied unto ſuch, their Non-compliance is enough to make 'em <hi>Schiſmatical,</hi> to cut them off from Chriſt, and the hopes of Salvation, which being no ways juſtifiable in the Conſcience of any ſober man, the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are unjuſtly Excommunicated; and he that ſo Excommunicates, is <hi>Schiſmatical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis moſt certain, That many good Chriſtians cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the impoſed terms of Communion with the <hi>Church,</hi> and that for this ſingle Reaſon they are Excommunicable, if not actually Excommunicated from the <hi>Church;</hi> that is, put out of a ſtate of Salvation. The which being ſo, 'twill unavoidably follow, <hi>That either the Excommunication is unjuſt;</hi> or, <hi>That the Church hath greater Power, than he that is the Lord of it, to open and ſhut the gates of Heaven.</hi> If the <hi>latter,</hi> then the <hi>Church</hi> ſets itſelf up above all that is called God in this world, and Chriſt in the other. For whereas Repentance towards God, and Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is ſufficient for our Salvation; theſe add ſomwhat more, to wit, an Obedience to new Impoſitions, threatning the neglect with Damnation. But if the <hi>former,</hi> if the Excommunication is <hi>unjuſt,</hi> then according to Dr. <hi>Gunning,</hi> with the addition of our Author, <hi>Our Eccleſiaſtical Governours are the Schiſmaticks.</hi> The Argument here in ſhort is this;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He that doth unjuſtly Excommunicate any out of the Catholick Church, is a Schiſmatick.</hi> This is Dr. <hi>Gunning's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the Church of</hi> England, <hi>ſhutting thoſe out of Salvation to whom Chriſt hath promiſed it, Excommunicates unjuſtly.</hi> This is our Authors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore the Church of</hi> England, according to the Poſition of our Author, <hi>is the Schiſmatick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hereby we may eaſily perceive, what an admirable Defender the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> hath, in the Defender of the <hi>Dean;</hi> and how little the <hi>true Proteſtant</hi> Clergy of the <hi>Church</hi> are beholding to this man, who inſiſts on ſuch Notions as do neceſſarily lead judicious men to conclude the <hi>Church of</hi> England <hi>Schiſmatical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:61768:54"/>
                  <p>But to return to our Author, who leaping over all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, though but hinted in the <hi>Enquiry,</hi> runs unto another Queſtion, viz. <hi>From Ceremonies</hi> to <hi>Circumſtances;</hi> form the <hi>Parts of their Religion,</hi> to the <hi>external Appendages</hi> thereunto, confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the one with the other, and then runs triumphantly, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring his <hi>Reader,</hi> That 'tis impoſſible to worſhip God, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe any act of Religion, but it muſt be in <hi>ſome time,</hi> or in ſome place; it muſt be done in <hi>ſome circumſtances,</hi> therefore we may make ſome things a part of our Religion, which God has not. At this rate he fills up a great part of his <hi>Second Chapter.</hi> Inſiſting on nothing but what had its anſwer in that <hi>Enquiry</hi> he attempted to confute. Therefore if I ſhould ſay no more than what I have in giving the true ſtate of the Controverſie, it would be ſufficient: For it lies on him either to prove to our <hi>Conviction,</hi> that <hi>We may without ſin comply with their Impoſitions,</hi> (i. e.) He muſt ſo far effectually enlighten our Conſcience, as to help us to ſee, that the <hi>Impoſitions</hi> are not ſinful, and that we may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Conform; or ſhew, <hi>That we muſt Conform contrary to the Convictions of our Conſciences, and render a blind Obedience unto their Commands,</hi> Believing as the <hi>Church</hi> believes; or they ought to remove the Impoſitions, or acknowledge that our Complian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not ſinful. One of theſe muſt be done. Let him do either, and the Controverſie will be ended, and the Diſſenters freed from <hi>Schiſme.</hi> But if he cannot enlighten us to ſee the Lawfulneſs of their Impoſitions, nor perſwade us to render a blind Obedience, nor remove the Impoſitions, but plead for their continuance, 'twill appear, That <hi>they</hi> by impoſing what in their <hi>Judgments</hi> is but <hi>Indifferent, as things neceſſary to our Salvation,</hi> are the <hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi> This might ſuffice as a full Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>But that nothing may eſcape conſideration, that our <hi>Author</hi> may think deſerves it, Ple reflect a little on his main ſtrength. <hi>If there be any force in this Argument</hi> (ſays he) <hi>it conſiſts in theſe two things: Firſt, That all things which are in their own nature indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, may without ſin be parted with. And ſecondly, That the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Diſſenters, That indifferent things are unlawful in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, is a juſt reaſon for parting with them: For if it be not lawful to part with every thing that is</hi> indifferent, <hi>thoſe who retain the uſe of ſome indifferent things, cannot meerly upon that account be called Dividers or Schiſmaticks; and if the opinion of Diſſenters that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61768:54"/>all indifferent things are unlawful, be not a ſufficient reaſon for part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, then there may be no fault in the Epiſcopals</hi> will not, <hi>nor a ſufficient juſtification or excuſe in the Diſſenters</hi> cannot. p. 9.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſaith he, <hi>If there be any force in this Argument, it conſiſts in two things:</hi> Firſt, <hi>That all things which are in their own nature indifferent, may without ſin be parted with.</hi> This is his miſtake; he ſhould have ſaid, That if there be any ſtrength in the <hi>Enquiry,</hi> it lyes in this, viz. <hi>No one indifferent Ceremony muſt be made ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary a part of Religion, as to be a term of Communion.</hi> 'Tis this he ſhould have conſidered. For you ſin by inſiſting on any one, or more indifferent things ſo zealouſly as to make 'em terms of Communion with your <hi>Church,</hi> and conſequently with the <hi>Church Catholick;</hi> ſo as to deny us a right to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and Salvation, for a mere non-compliance. You can part with your indifferent Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies without ſin, and open the door of Salvation to the wretched Diſſenter if you will, even when they <hi>cannot</hi> without ſin comply with your intolerable Impoſitions. The indifferent things you impoſe, you impoſe as terms of our Communion with you, which you make to be the ſame with <hi>Catholick</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, that is of Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You add the ſecond thing, viz. <hi>That the Opinion of Diſſenters, That Indifferent things are unlawful, is a juſt reaſon for parting with them. For if it be not,</hi> ſay you, <hi>lawful to part with every thing that is indifferent; thoſe who retain the uſe of Indifferent things, cannot merely upon that account be called Dividers, or</hi> Schiſmaticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſhould remember, that I diſtinguiſhed between <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> and <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> between what is a part of Religion, and Intrinſecal thereunto, and what is Extrinſecal only: But you run to external Circumſtances that are neceſſary in <hi>Theſi,</hi> which is off from the point in hand.</p>
                  <p>You run from what is <hi>Indifferent</hi> to what is <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> as if we called you to part with any neceſſary thing; whereas there is never any indifferent Ceremony that is grievous to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, but you may part with, or ceaſe to impoſe 'em, and yet worſhip God. But to divide neceſſary circumſtances of Action from the Action, is impoſſible. A thing we no way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>

                  <p>But as to the true ſtate of the Controverſie, 'tis another thing; you make <hi>that a part of Religion</hi> which <hi>God hath not made;</hi> you impoſe <hi>uninſtituted</hi> ceremonies, and in many things recede from the <hi>Apoſtolical Inſtitution,</hi> and call on us on pain of damnation to comply with you.

                  <p>Theſe things being thus plain, I'le gratiſie our Authors deſire in conſidering his Logick. <hi>If the Diſſenters can without ſin</hi> (ſays he) <hi>obey their Governours in</hi> indifferent, <hi>that is,</hi> in lawful things, <hi>but will not; and the Epiſcopal would be content to part with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things for union, but</hi> cannot, <hi>who is the Divider? What muſt be done for Union? Muſt the Diſſenters comply in things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they can without ſin; or muſt the Epiſcopal ſin and loſe their peace with God fot Union?</hi> p. 29.</p>
                  <p>This is called by our <hi>Author</hi> an Argument, but why, I cannot imagine; however let it be ſo, wherein lies its ſtrength, or how comes it to paſs, that this cannot be anſwered, without a ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Sophiſtry</hi> to be where 'tis not?</p>
                  <p>If there be any force in this Argument, it muſt be either in this, viz. <hi>That the Impoſitions are in the judgment of the Diſſenters Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> or <hi>Indifferent,</hi> which may be ſubmitted unto without ſin. Had this ſuggeſtion been true, we would grant him the whole he deſires, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Diſſenters refuſing to do what is Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in their own judgment to be done for Union, they are <hi>Faulty.</hi> But 'tis notirious, That the impoſed terms are of ſuch a nature, that they cannot be ſubmitted unto by the Diſſenter, but he muſt grievouſly offend the moſt high God, to the wounding his own conſcience.</p>

What is the matter that they <hi>cannot</hi> part with <hi>toys</hi> and <hi>trifles</hi> to take many a thouſand within the pale of the Church, and thereby help 'em to Heaven? The things are ſtill ſuppoſed indifferent by our Author, and therefore a parting with 'em is not contrary to any Law, nor <hi>ſinful.</hi> Why then can they not without ſin part with, what they can part with without ſin? This is ſurely myſterious! They cannot part with that without ſin, which they can part with without ſin, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61768:56"/>Yet will not part with it, though according to their own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their not parting with their indifferent things tends to the unavoidable deſtruction of ſouls.

Whence then did I ſay, <hi>What muſt muſt be done for Union?</hi> I may now ſay, <hi>What muſt be done to ſave the thouſands of Souls for whom Chriſt died?</hi> Muſt the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> part with what they <hi>can</hi> without ſin, and take the Diſſenters into the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſave their Souls; or muſt the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> ſin that they may be ſaved? What, Is there no way to Heaven for <hi>Engliſh</hi> Diſſenters, but their complying with <hi>ſinful</hi> Impoſitions? "Twas ſaid in the Apoſtles days, that <hi>We muſt not do evil, that good may come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> Then ſurely, if we will be of the Apoſtles judgment, <hi>We muſt not ſin, to ſave our Souls.

For the reaſon why I mentioned this, was to obviate a common Objection, viz. <hi>How can you parallel the Doctor and</hi> Bellarmine <hi>in this, ſeeing the Doctor cries up Union ſo much, as the deſigne of his great Book, as well as of his Sermon?</hi> To which I reply, That though the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> were Dividing, yet he cries up Union; for which reaſon though the Doctor applauds <hi>Union,</hi> yet in doing ſo, doth no more than <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and therefore may be as much a Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> notwithſtanding thoſe many plauſible Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes concerning the excellency of Union; for Union is a lovely name in the judgment of ſuch as will do nothing to obtain <hi>the thing.</hi>

                  <p>Sir, If the caſe be narrowly ſearched into, you will find, that in all times ſince the firſt Reformation, thoſe call'd <hi>Puritans</hi> were a block in the way to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Englands</hi> paſſing over towards <hi>Rome.</hi> Had it not been for the Induſtry of the <hi>Nonconformiſt,</hi> as all the forreign Proteſtant <hi>Churches</hi> beyond the Seas are <hi>Unchur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched</hi> by our high-flown Epiſcopal men, even ſo they ſhould have been abandon'd as <hi>Heretical,</hi> but that the <hi>Diſſenter</hi> makes ſuch a clamour on all occaſions about <hi>Popery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You have very ingeniouſly diſtinguiſh'd between the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and have taken the moſt effectual care to endeavour that favour might be ſhewn the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> even when you cry down <hi>Popery;</hi> as if the common People had underſtood by <hi>Popery</hi> no more than your ſelf, namely the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> whereas they think, that when you cry down <hi>Popery,</hi> you are enemies to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> A pretty juggle! Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery is an odious thing, even when to be a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> is worthy of all applauſe. <hi>Laud</hi> was no <hi>Papiſt,</hi> he was an enemy to <hi>Popery,</hi> when a cordial Friend to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome. Popery</hi> is deteſtable, when all the care imaginable muſt be taken, that nothing be done to the diſguſt of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> Conſult <hi>Bramhall</hi> and <hi>Heylin,</hi> to mention no more, to ſee whether theſe be not their Sentiments.</p>
                  <p>You boaſt ſtrangely of King <hi>Edwards</hi> Reformaton, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how ſhort of it, in ſome things, you are fall'n. You repreſent us as blaſters of the Reformation begun in his days, not duely minding what one of your own Faction, Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> hath ſaid on't in his <hi>Preface to the Hiſtory of the Reformation:</hi>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:61768:58"/>Take the Character he gives of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th, and make the moſt of it; 'tis this, <hi>Scarce had they</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>brought it,</hi> [<hi>viz.</hi> the Reformation] <hi>to paſs, when</hi> Edward <hi>died, whoſe death I cannot reckon for an Infelicity to the Church of</hi> England. <hi>For being</hi> ill-principled in himſelf, <hi>and eaſily inclin'd to embrace ſuch Counſels as were offered to him, it is not to be thought but that the reſt of the Biſhopricks (before ſufficiently impoveriſhed) muſt have followed</hi> Durham, <hi>and the poor Church be left as deſtitute of Lands and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, as when ſhe came into the world in her natural Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From theſe words of <hi>Heylin</hi> 'tis evident, That ſuch as are of this <hi>Grotian</hi> Faction, do reflect ſufficiently on the Reformation then begun, and alſo plainly enough ſuggeſt, That if K. <hi>Edward</hi> had lived longer, the Reformation had gone on further than you or your party deſire; it may be they would have gone on ſo far as thoſe you now call <hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi> If ſo, how comes it to paſs that the Diſſenters by acting ſo agreeably to what King <hi>Edwards</hi> Proteſtants would have done, caſt any reproach on that ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily begun Reformation?</p>
                  <p>In fine, It cannot but amuſe wiſe men, to obſerve how pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> and his Subſtitute inſiſt on the Diſſenters ſubſerviency to the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Intereſt: Whereas 'tis moſt manifeſt, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves do with the greateſt confidence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude none more oppoſite, nor more injurious to their Deſigns than the Diſſenter. However, ſeeing one Diſſenter ſpake but a word for the forbearance of a meer conſcientious Papiſt, this is enough to animate thoſe Gentlemen to load the whole Party with the reproach of being great friends to Popery. The which is the more remarkable, becauſe all this cry is even when a Son of the Church, yea a Reverend Divine of that name hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a Volume in favour of the Church though not of the Court) of <hi>Rome,</hi> without any notice taken of it. And the Dean himſelf in that very Preface in which he ſo much declaims againſt the Diſſenter, doth ſpeak much more in favour of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> than any Diſſenter ever did; for he himſelf aſſerts, <hi>That it will be thought great hardſhip when mens heats are ever, for them only</hi> (viz.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61768:58"/>the Papiſts) <hi>to be deprived of the liberty of their Conſciences, when the wildeſt Fanaticks are allow'd it.</hi> p. 79.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, what is matter of greater ſurpriſe is, That all this ſtir is rais'd from one word out of a Diſſenters mouth, even when great things have been done by ſome who pretend to be ſons of the Church, in favour of the Papiſt, to the turning the edg of thoſe Laws that were made againſt <hi>Papiſts</hi> on Proteſtant Diſſenters, without any remark; as if it had been highly merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in a Church-man to act for all <hi>Papiſts</hi> in the general, tho' an unpardonable crime in a Diſſenter to ſpeak but one word for the ſuppoſed conſcientious only.</p>
                  <p>That ſome of the Church of <hi>England</hi> have acted in favour of all ſorts of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> to the advancing <hi>Popery,</hi> is notorious, as hath been obſerved by Sir <hi>Francis Winnington</hi> at the Trial of the Lord <hi>Stafford. Another encouragement, my Lord</hi> (faith Sir <hi>Fr. W.) which the Papiſts had, was, That by the means of thoſe Miniſters who were ſecretly of their Faction, whenever his Majeſty was pleaſed to command the Laws made againſt them in the Reign of Q.</hi> Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth <hi>and K.</hi> James, <hi>to be put in due execution, his good intentions were fruſtrated, and the ſeverity of thoſe Laws was turn'd upon the</hi> Proteſtant Diſſenters. <hi>This was a Maſter piece of</hi> Rome, <hi>not only to divert from themſelves the edg of thoſe</hi> Laws <hi>which were deſign'd againſt them; but to turn them upon the</hi> Proteſtants, <hi>and to make them uſeful to advance the</hi> Romiſh <hi>Intereſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame is alſo the ſenſe of the <hi>Commons</hi> aſſembled in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> as is to be ſeen in their Addreſs unto his <hi>Majeſty, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> 29.1680. Where they declare unto his Majeſty in theſe words, <hi>At home, if your Majeſty did at any time by the advice of your Privy Council, or of your Two Houſes of Parliament, command the Laws to be put in execution againſt</hi> Papiſts, <hi>even from thence they gain'd advantage to their Party, while the edg of thoſe Laws was turned againſt</hi> Proteſtant Diſſenters, <hi>and the</hi> Papiſts <hi>eſcap'd in a manner untouch'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus many a Son of the Church have heretofore taken an
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61768:59"/>eſpecial care to turn the edg of Laws againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> on the <hi>Diſſenter.</hi> But this is not ſpeaking for a forbearance; 'tis but an actual affording forbearance to 'em all in general. Of which one word muſt not be ſpoke. As if ſuch men as our Author would that all the Reſpects which are had for <hi>Papiſts,</hi> muſt be confin'd to them, who alone without offence may ſhew it 'em.</p>
                  <p>But 'tis pretty evident, that there are other <hi>Conformiſts</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mind, as may appear by the <hi>Countrey-Conformiſts further Reply</hi> to this <hi>Defence,</hi> or <hi>Vindication,</hi> which we have received from him in theſe Sheets following, and to which I refer my Reader.</p>

               </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAVING information that you are Printing ſom Papers of others in Anſwer to the Defence of Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet,</hi> I have thought fit upon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to ſend you theſe three or four ſheets to put in, as one concern'd among the reſt.</p>
            <p>The young <hi>Hero</hi> that hath written this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, hath treated his Antagoniſts with no leſs a ſupercilious contempt than the Dr.; but he hath not written his Book with the like judgment and ſenſe. I cannot ſay that he hath in any thing confuted them; but he doth groſly pervert their words, and give them a meaning which is contrary to their intention, and then drolls upon it, and mightily pleaſes himſelf in his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory and Succeſs. And this he hath done almoſt throughout his Book.</p>
            <p>He that reads the Book, and doth nor compare it with the Authors whom he pretends to Anſwer, may perhaps think there is ſomething in it: But if he ſhall diligently do this, he will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his opinion. I will inſtance in one particular: Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> among other things, objects the renunciation of the Covenant for our <hi>ſelves</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> when <hi>we know not their ſenſe.</hi> Theſe laſt words he interprets of the <hi>Takers</hi> of that Covenant, when Mr. <hi>B.</hi> meant it of the <hi>Impoſers;</hi> and no wonder then if he makes fine work of it.</p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>Reflections</hi> hath reaſon to take notice of theſe his dealings in this kind; and I do foreſee how he is like to fare again; yet being one for whom I have ſo near a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, I cannot refuſe a ſheet or two (having this intimation) in his behalf, eſpecially ſeeing he is a Son of the Church; and 'tis convenient his Brethren ſhould rightly underſtand him.</p>
            <p>It is in the Preface I am engaged; and (p. 3.) thus he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61768:60"/>
               <hi>The Countrey Conformiſt in his Reflections on Dr.</hi> Stilling fleet, <hi>endeavours to excuſe Mr.</hi> B. <hi>from intending the D. of St.</hi> Pauls, <hi>in that lewd character that he gave, of a m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt unskilful, proud, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, obſtinate, impertinent Adverſary, by making it the deſcription of ſuch Subſtitutes as had neither the Candor nor. Learning of the Doctor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He did ſo; and how doth this Gentleman prove that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured it to no purpoſe? Why even thus: <hi>However any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Reader will ſee cauſe to believe, that Mr.</hi> B. <hi>had the Dean in his eye, tho' he had not courage enough to apply every thing to him, but left his Readers to apply as much as they pleaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply, There's no Impartial Reader can believe that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> intended the Dr. in that lewd Character, as he is pleaſed to call it; and it is a rare faculty this Author hath of miſrepreſenting the words of other men, and to put his ſenſe upon them as he liſts, and then brazen it out. I will add with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that it ſeems a little ſtrange that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> that hath courage enough to <hi>libel Church and State,</hi> as this Author often ſays, and to <hi>caſt dirt upon the Church and Church-men,</hi> as 'tis in his next page, ſhould be afraid to apply to the Dr. any part of that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter which he thought did belong to him.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman proceeds in the ſame page, <hi>But ſuppoſe he meant this of ſuch Subſtitutes as had neither the Candor nor Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Dr. I reckon a man may fall many degrees ſhort of the Dr. and yet not deſerve ſuch a character, or be unworthy of Mr.</hi> B<hi>'s notice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, the queſtion is not, Whether a perſon may not fall many degrees ſhort of the Dr. and yet not deſerve that Character; but whether a perſon may not fall ſo far beneath him, as to deſerve it, and yet officiouſly ſubſtitute himſelf in the place of the Learned Doctor; and whether ſuch an one may not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of Mr. <hi>B's</hi> notice?</p>
            <p>Our Author adds, p. 4. <hi>As for the former</hi> (i. e. <hi>Candour</hi>) <hi>I confeſs a very great proportion of that is neceſſary for any man, that will treat Mr.</hi> B. <hi>with any tolerable Civility, when in all his late Writings he caſts ſo much dirt upon the Church and Churchmen: And this Author will not allow the Dean himſelf any great ſhare of that, though he has very ſparingly, conſidering the frequent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61768:60"/>and very decently and modeſtly, conſidering the occaſions he takes for it, rebuked that huſſing Diſputant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, That Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath reproved the faults of Churchmen in words pretty plain and ſharp, I do eaſily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, (and ſo have ſome regular Sons of the Church done alſo; See <hi>Englands faithful Reprover and Monitor;</hi> and a Book called <hi>Ichabod.</hi>) But that he hath thrown dirt upon them, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſpeaking truth be caſting dirt) I ſhall not eaſily grant; and I am of opinion, if this Author and ſome others had lived in the days of the old Prophets, yea and of the Son of God himſelf, and had heard their Sermons and Diſcourſes, they would have ſaid, That they Defamed the Governors of the <hi>Church,</hi> and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled the <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That a great deal of candour is neceſſary for thoſe that will treat ſuch as reprove them with Civility, I do eaſily concede, yea and a great deal of Humility, Self-denial, Tenderneſs of Conſcience, and the fear of God too; But all this is no more than their Duty, and if they had any conſiderable meaſure or degree of theſe Virtues, they would find no great difficulty in treating ſuch as reprove them with Reſpect and Kindneſs.</p>
            <p>As to what concerns the Learned Doctor, I have always eſteemed him, and do to this day, a perſon of Candour; but good men are ſometimes tranſported, and do ſuch things as are inconſiſtent with the habitual Temper and Conſtitution of their own Mindes: And I hope the excellent Dr. ſuffered ſome ſuch kind of Tranſport, when he replied to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in his late Book.</p>
            <p>That the Dr. did very ſparingly, decently and modeſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke Mr. <hi>B.</hi> which this Author calls a <hi>huſſing Diſputant,</hi> I ſhall grant alſo, if the Doctor's rebukes be compared with this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. For he hath obſerved no Laws of Modeſty, Decency or Decorum therein, but after a moſt profuſe and ſcornful manner hath reproached and deſpiſed him, to his own greater Infamy and Reproach. For Mr. <hi>B's</hi> Reputation for Learning and Judgment is too firmly eſtabliſhed in the minds of Impartial and Unbiaſſed men, that all that he can ſay to abate it, will be but throwing water on a rock, that will return and daſh himſelf.</p>
            <p>In the ſame page he addes, <hi>As for the latter,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> Learning) <hi>I acknowledg my ſelf ſuch a Subſtitute, as may not compare with the Doctor.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="98" facs="tcp:61768:61"/>
            <p>This I think (bating the Texts of Scripture which he quotes) is one of the trueſt paſſages in all his Book; and I have a Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for truth, and will not ſpeak any thing to the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of it; but let the Author have the honour of having ſpoke it once at leaſt in a Book of ſix or ſeven hundred Pages.</p>
            <p>Page the 5th he ſays, <q>I ſhall begin with the Reflecter, who writes himſelf a Conformiſt Miniſter in the Country; and this is the only thing conſiderable in it, that it is the teſtimony of one of our own Church againſt the Dean of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and for his adverſaries: And for that reaſon Mr. <hi>B.</hi> at the end of his Anſwers refers his Readers to him, that thoſe may receive that from a Conformiſt, which he will not receive from ſuch an one as he.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And then he addes; <q>But what is this to the purpoſe? If there be ſome ſuch Conformiſts among us now, as there were in 1643, who raiſed a Church-War, and then pulled down Church and State, to ſet up a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Party? and ſuch a Conformiſt our Reflecter is, who vindicates Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Parochial Epiſcopacy, which is but a new name for Presbytery, as I have proved in the following Treatiſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, I had thought our Author had begun with the Reflecter ſome time ſince; but peradventure what he hath hitherunto ſaid, hath been only like the ſlight velitations of the Avant-guards of an Army; he intends now to fall to down-right blows: Be it ſo, 'tis to be hoped the Reflecter may ſurvive his moſt powerful Impreſſions, and the rudeſt of his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults: For though he talks like one of the Sons of <hi>Anak,</hi> for ought that I can ſee, be <hi>performs</hi> as little, and ſomething leſs than other men, that do only but <hi>talk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to proceed to the matter; I will aſſure him, that the Countrey-Conformiſt gives no teſtimony againſt the Dean of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> or for his Adverſaries, but out of the Love and Zeal that he hath for Peace. The <hi>Church</hi> of God in this Nation is broken into pieces, <hi>Ephraim</hi> is againſt <hi>Manaſſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> againſt <hi>Ephraim;</hi> and this I dare ſay is indeed matter of ſad Meditation (for I know him very well) to the Countrey-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt, who hath no other Controverſie with the Reverend and Learned Doctor, than on the behalf of Peace.</p>
            <p>As to what our Author ſays concerning thoſe Conformiſts that raiſed a War in 1643. and pulled down <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:61768:61"/>to ſet up a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> parity, the <hi>Countrey Conformiſt</hi> hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay, unleſs it be to aſſure him, That as he had nothing to do in that, ſo he never intends to have any thing to do in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. He is no admirer of that which this Gentleman calls a <hi>Presbyterian Parity;</hi> he very well likes of <hi>Dicceſan Epiſcopacy,</hi> provided their Dioceſſes be no bigger than they were in the firſt two hundred years, yea, than they were in the third and fourth Centuries, in moſt parts of the Chriſtian world. Let us have but ſuch Churches and ſuch Biſhops, with <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,</hi> as were in the Churches of <hi>Corinth, J<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>lem,</hi> and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi> in the days of <hi>Clemens, James,</hi> and <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Conformiſt</hi> is ſatisfied, and ſo would Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and moſt <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts</hi> in <hi>England</hi> beſides. Whether this kind of <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> be a new name for <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and whether this Author have proved it, I leave to ſuch <hi>Readers</hi> to judg, as can <hi>conſider</hi> as well as <hi>read</hi> his Book.</p>
            <p>But how comes this Gentleman to know that the <hi>Countrey Conformiſt</hi> is ſuch a one as thoſe that raiſed a Civil War ſome years ago, and pulled down Church and State to ſet up a <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery?</hi> Can a man oppoſe nothing that is defended by ſome Church-men, but he muſt immediately be reported a ſecret Traytor or Rebel? Is this becoming Chriſtianity, or the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of it? Do theſe men believe the Goſpel, that dare ſlander and traduce their brethren in ſuch a <hi>villanous</hi> manner? 'Tis a word I received from him, I hope he will take it agen. Tho' it ſhould be granted the Miter ſupports the Crown; yet ſurely the Errors and Vices of Church-men give no ſupport unto it; and I am of opinion, that a man may ſpeak for peace, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the opinions and corruption of Churches and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and yet be a very good ſubject to his Prince, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that perpetual buz of Rebellion that is ſuggeſted by ſome Huffs in the prejudice of ſuch men and their diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>But why did I enquire how this <hi>Monſieur</hi> came to know that the <hi>Countrey Conformiſt</hi> was ſuch another as thoſe that raiſed the Rebellion in forty three? The nature of the aſſertion betrays the Author of the Information, and there needs no great skill in Magick to find him; yet leſt he ſhould be ignorant of him, I will be ſo kind as to tell his name, he is called <hi>Beclzebub</hi> the Father of lyes; and I hope when he writes agen, he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61768:62"/>of him, and hold better correſpondencies for his informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Pag. 7. he adds: <hi>Our Conformiſt doth plainly deride the Dean for thinking he can juſtifie our preſent Epiſcopacy;</hi> and then quotes his words as followeth: <hi>But the Dr. makes no queſtion but he ſhall confute this fanciful man, and make it appear, that our preſent Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy (which Mr. B. oppoſes) is agreeable to the inſtitution of Chriſt, and the beſt and moſt flouriſhing Churches.</hi> And eaſily he may, if Mr. <hi>B.</hi> be ſuch a pitiful Antagoniſt.</p>
            <p>But what is there in theſe words that ſavour of deriſion? I have read and conſidered them agen and agen, and I cannot find it by all the ſearch that I can make. The Learned Dr. had pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and given ſufficient evidence of the mean opinion he had of his performances in his late Books, and particularly in his Treatiſe of <hi>Epiſcopacy;</hi> and is it to deride the Dean to ſay, he may eaſily confute ſo contemptible an Adverſary? This I confeſs I cannot underſtand.</p>
            <p>And yet after all I am not ſatisfied, that the Learned Dr. or his Defender hath confuted what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath ſaid in prejudice to our preſent Dioceſan Epiſcopacy; he ſays that the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Dioceſſes hath varied the ſpecies of Epiſcopacy; and gives many arguments for the proof of it, which neither the Dr. nor this Gentleman hath attempted to anſwer.</p>
            <p>I know the latter of them ſays, that the enlargement of Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes doth not vary the ſpecies of Biſhops; and that a great and a little King are ſpecifically the ſame Governours: But I can by no means believe this to be true of Biſhops, whatever it be of Kings: For the Dioceſs of the Pope is only bigger than that of the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> or <hi>Worceſter,</hi> or <hi>Lincoln</hi>; and yet I think they are Governours ſpecifically diſtinct, and I hope this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman thinks ſo too. Yea, give me leave to ſuppoſe that there were but two Biſhops in <hi>England,</hi> there would be only a gradual difference in their Dioceſs, and yet I ſuſpect ſome men would think that the Government were ſpecifically altered; but let not our Author infer that this ſuppoſition is my deſire (for he is apt to pervert mens words), for I will aſſure him, that I do not deſire it, but would have many more Biſhops, not leſs.</p>
            <p>In fine, 'tis my opinion, that the needs of the Church, and the abilities of Biſhops to perform the work of the Epiſcopal Office,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61768:62"/>ought to determine the extent of their Dioceſs. Let their Dioceſſes be as big as they can manage and no bugger, and if ſo, I am ſure they muſt be reduced to ſmaller limits than now they are. No Biſhop can diſcharge the proper work of his Office in a thouſand, or five hundred Pariſhes; nay, I will ſay, That there are many ſingle Pariſhes in <hi>England</hi> that will employ the moſt induſtrious Biſhops on earth.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, that they do perform the proper work of their Office in many Pariſhes, I utterly deny it, that the work is not done, and thence proceeds the prophaneſs and wickedneſs of particular Churches; and thence follows the Schiſms, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations that have and do vex this Church at this day.</p>
            <p>Pag. ib. Our Author proceeds: <hi>He pleads</hi> (i. e. the Countrey Conformiſt) <hi>for taking off the Impoſitions</hi> (in general without any limitation) to receive the Presbyterians again into our Church, which before he told us, <hi>were Subſcriptions, Declarations,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>ſome few Alterations beſides: That is,</hi> faith our Commentator, <hi>either a form of Prayer, or at leaſt our preſent Liturgy, Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and Adminiſtration of religious Offices: Now he is an admirable Conformiſt indeed, who at once grants away the Epiſcopal Office, and inſtead of it, ſetteth up a Biſhop in every Pariſh; or either an Anti-Chriſtian Biſhop of Biſhops, or an Eccleſiaſtical Miniſter of State to head and govern them, and alters the whole frame of our Worſhip; and into the bargain leaves every man to do as he ſaith, and all this without injuring our preſent Conſtitution: Nay he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, That all thoſe that hinder the Union of Presbyterians with this Church, by continuing the Impoſitions, are Factors for the Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this paragraph are a great many falſhoods. He charges the Countrey Conformiſt with pleading for the Admiſſion of the Presbyterians into the Church, without any Impoſitions, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, or Declarations. This was very ill done of him, if it be true, which I do a little ſuſpect, becauſe this Gentleman is ſo apt to miſunderſtand, and miſrepreſent the words and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Adverſaries. The Country Conformiſt hath declared in ſeveral places of his Books, That he pleads the Cauſe of none but <hi>tolerable</hi> Diſſenters; and for the Admiſſion of none into the Church, but ſuch as can Officiate in our Parochial Aſſemblies; but how this difference can be made without Impoſitions, or Subſcriptions, is not imaginable: And therefore to ſay no more,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61768:63"/>I think this Author hath injur'd and wronged him, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his judgment.</p>
            <p>And wheras by thoſe <hi>few Alterations beſides,</hi> that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Conformiſt ſpeaks of, he underſtands either a Form of Prayer, or the preſent Liturgy, Ceremonies, and Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religious Offices, 'tis his own Comment, and he is not obliged to confute it. Yet thus much I will ſay on his behalf, that upon my knowledg, he is in his judgment for a Form of Prayer in Publique-Offices, and Adminiſtrations, and hath a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hearty eſteem for that of our <hi>Church;</hi> but I cannot ſay ſo of the Ceremonies; I think he might be eaſily perſwaded to part with them; and if ſome exceptionable paſſages in the Liturgy and Rubricks were altered, I believe he would make no oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to it.</p>
            <p>But he charges this <hi>admirable Conformiſt</hi> (as he is pleaſed to call him) with giving away at once the Epiſcopal Office, and inſtead of it ſets up a Biſhop in every Pariſh, and either an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Biſhop of Biſhops, or an Eccleſiaſtical Miniſter of State to govern them. How little there is of truth in this charge, may be collected from what I have ſaid already. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt ſets up no more Biſhops than the neceſſities of the <hi>Church</hi> and the duty and work of the Epiſcopal-Office requires; and I underſtand not that this is giving away the Epiſcopal Office: And if this Author can free Metropolitan Biſhops from Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianiſm, which he ſays <hi>ſome do derive from the very days of the Apoſtles, and that not without ſome good appearance of Reaſon,</hi> I hope the Conformiſt will defend the <hi>Epiſcopi Epiſcoporum</hi> from that appellation.</p>
            <p>As to what he ſays of an Eccleſiaſtical Miniſter of State, the Conformiſt hath no more to reply than this; He hopes this Gentleman will not plead an Exemption for the Clergy from under the Civil Magiſtrates Power and Government; and if this be granted, I know not what can be matter of Controverſie between him and this Author: For he ſuppoſes him to exerciſe no Power over the Biſhops, but what is inherent in the King, and in this Miniſter of State by Delegation; that is in few words, to ſee that they do their own Duty carefully, reprove their Negligence and Male-adminiſtrations, and preſerve peace among them. And what is there in this Doctrine that our
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61768:63"/>Author ſhould take ſuch offence at, I am yet to ſeek.</p>
            <p>He addes, <hi>And alters the whole frame of our Worſhip, leaves every man to do as he liſts, and all this without injury to our preſent Conſtitution.</hi> In theſe Lines, to ſpeak plainly, there is not one word of truth, as any man may eaſily collect from what I have ſaid already: And this Gentleman himſelf confeſſes in the next page, <hi>That the Conformiſt will not indeed allow of univerſal Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> How this can be reconciled with <hi>Leaving all men to do as they liſt,</hi> I am not able to tell.</p>
            <p>That the Conformiſt ſaid, That thoſe that hinder the Union of <hi>Presbyterians</hi> with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> by continuing the Impoſitions, are Factors for the Pope, I do eaſily acknowledg, and I believe he is ſtill of the ſame minde; and as I remember he gave ſome Reaſons for it too, which this Gentleman takes, no notice of. When he confutes them, perhaps he may hear of a Vindication, if there be juſt reaſon for it.</p>
            <p>Pag. the 8th he proceeds thus; <hi>He (i.e.</hi> the Conform.) <hi>pleads for the Indulgence of others, particularly the Independents, who,</hi> he ſays, <hi>will be content with their own Congregations, and is mightily taken with Mr.</hi> Humfreys <hi>Project, That the tolerated Churches (ſuch as Independents) be declared parts of the National Church, whereof the King to be the Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Countrey-Conformiſt is ſo great a Lover of Peace, that I do eaſily ſuppoſe he might be pleaſed with Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s <hi>Project,</hi> as he calls it; and I do aſſure him, that I my ſelf am much more pleaſed with it, ſince I read his Book, than I was before, though I had always a value for it: For I think the Deſign of uniting the Diſſenting Proteſtants in this Nation, is into one National <hi>Church,</hi> whereof the King to be the Head, more laudable than the deſign of uniting Proteſtants in a General Council, or in a Pope, Primate, or Metropolitan, which ſeems to be the deſign of our Author, though he hath not Courage, or Inſtruction e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough as yet to ſpeak it out.</p>
            <p>For he affirms, 1. <hi>That the Epiſcopal Office and Power is but one, and not reſident in the Biſhops of the Univerſal Church,</hi> p. 212. 2. <hi>That the Independency of Biſhops is inconſiſtent with Eccleſiaſtical Unity,</hi> p. 115. <hi>And</hi> 3. <hi>that although equals have no Authority over one the other, yet a Collegue hath Authority over any one of his Collegues,</hi> p. 213. 4. <hi>That the Bonds and Combinations of Churches
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61768:64"/>are of Divine Right, though the ordering and determination of them be of Humane Prudence,</hi> p. 258. 5. <hi>That the Unity of the Church is as much of Divine Right, as any Form of Government in it; and that the whole Church may be divided into greater or leſſer parts, as may beſt ſerve the ends of Peace and Unity. And that it ſeems ſtrange to him, that a National or Patriarchal Church ſhould not be thought as much a Divine Inſtitution, as any particular Church,</hi> p. 259. And further he adds, <hi>When Chriſt and his Apoſtles have inſtituted one Form of Government for all particular Churches, and commanded them all to live in Unity, Peace, Communion, and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Correſpondency with each other, the Union and Combination of Churches into one, according to this Inſtitution, to ſerve the ends of Catholick Communion, muſt be thought as much a Divine Inſtitution, as the bounds of particular Churches. For if we will not allow thoſe Churches to be of Divine Inſtitution, which have Officers of Divine Appointment, and are formed according to the general Directions of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, ſo as may ſerve the ends of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I know not where to find a Church of Divine Inſtitution in the world,</hi> pag. 259, 260.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the words of our Author; from whence we may collect many things for our Information.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That the Biſhops of the Catholique Church are the regent part thereof, in the ſame ſenſe that the Biſhops of any Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church are the regent part of that Church: For although there be no Superiority among Biſhops, their Power and Office being the ſame; yet Independency among them being incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Eccleſiaſtical Unity, both in the National and in the Univerſal <hi>Church,</hi> they are bound to unite for the Government of both, and this by Divine Command, Authority and Obligation.</item>
               <item>2. That whatſoever is determined by the Biſhops of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church,</hi> doth oblige all particular Biſhops and all Chriſtians all the world over; provided they determine nothing contrary to the Word of God.</item>
               <item>3. That whatever Biſhop ſhall refuſe their Canons and Determinations, and govern his particular Church by other Laws than they ſhall appoint, is a Schiſmatick, and they may Depoſe and Excommunicate him; yea, if a whole combination of Biſhops do refuſe to govern their National <hi>Church</hi> by their Laws, Appointments and Conſtitutions, they are all Schiſmaticks; and if the Nation refuſe to forſake ſuch Biſhops,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61768:64"/>they are all Schiſmaticks alſo, both they and their Biſhops are liable to the ſame Cenſure.</item>
               <item>4. That the external Union of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> conſiſts in their Union to and with the Biſhops thereof; that is, with a General Council. See <hi>pag.</hi> 595. where he makes <hi>Catholick Communion</hi> to conſiſt in two things;

                     <item>2. <hi>In the Communion of particular Churches and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians with each other.</hi> And he adds, <hi>That Catholick Communion is no arbitrary thing, but eſſential to the Church; and whoever violates it by an unreaſonable Diſſent, he is a Schiſmatick whoever he be, and no Member of the Catholick Church,</hi> pag. 601.</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
               <item>5. That Metrapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan &amp; Patriarchal <hi>Churches</hi> are of Divine Appointment, as much as any other <hi>Churches,</hi> &amp; muſt govern their <hi>Churches</hi> by ſuch Laws as are adviſed by a General Council, or by the Biſhops of the <hi>Church</hi> Univerſal; <hi>For although they be not founded on any expreſs Divine Law, yet they are warranted by our obligations to Catholick Unity,</hi> p. 293. And for my part, I am not able to ſee any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why the ſame obligations to Unity may not warrant one Papal <hi>Church,</hi> as well as three or four Patriarchal <hi>Churches</hi> in all the Chriſtian world. For the <hi>Papiſts</hi> think it the moſt effectual way to preſerve Unity, and for ought that I know they may think as wiſely as this Gentleman. I envy neither him nor them the pleaſure of their Dreams; but I hope there are but few <hi>Church</hi>-of-<hi>England</hi>-men that do think the ſame thoughts with him: theſe were the thoughts of <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> whom Biſhop <hi>Bramhal</hi> commends and defends: <hi>Unitas antiſtuis optimum eſt adverſus Schiſma remedium, quod &amp; Chriſtus monſtravit, &amp; Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rientia comprobavit.</hi> Vid.

            <p>I have quoted the words of this Author, and I am not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to my ſelf that I have perverted them, or made any ill deductions from them; and if it be his deſign to unite all <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> in the Decrees of General Councils, and in the Intervals of Councils in the Pope, or three or four Patriarchs, who are to govern according to their Canons; I do aſſure him, that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Mr. <hi>Humfry</hi>'s deſign far before it: For I am of opinion, 'tis a more Chriſtian Deſign to untie <hi>Proteſtants</hi> together and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, than to unite them with the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> Mr. <hi>Humfry</hi>'s Deſign I will tranſcribe from his Book, that thoſe

               <q>Archbiſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> hath left us his Model for an Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And it hath been upon the hearts generally of all mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſons, that a reduction of ſuch a Government into our <hi>Church,</hi> as was in the Primitive Times, (when there was a <hi>Conſeſſus Presbyterorum</hi> joyn'd with the Biſhop in all his Acts of Ordination and Juriſdiction) were the way, and only effectual way to our true Happineſs and Reformation. Unto which, if one thing more might be added, that is, If the Common-Prayer might be new <hi>caſt</hi> (it being fit that ſuch a <hi>veſſel</hi> for the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> ſhould be all of <hi>pure Gold</hi>) ſo as the whole of it were compoſed of <hi>Scripture-Phraſe</hi> altogether, leaving nothing at all liable any more to exception, unleſs the Impoſition of a Form only, (which I doubt not but is alſo juſtifiable by Scripture-Inſtances, as well as ſound Reaſon) it might go near to put an end to all Diſſention among the Sober and Peaceable of the Nation.</q>

                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:61768:65"/>for the ſake of any <hi>Antiquity</hi> whatſoever. They do hold <hi>Particular Churches</hi> to be of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Inſtitution, and <hi>Dioceſan</hi> of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Conſent</hi> only; and under the Notion of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> it is Sin to them to ſubmit to any <hi>Biſhop.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>There is another Notion then that muſt be advanced to take in theſe good Men of <hi>This Way,</hi> as well as thoſe of the <hi>Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial</hi> and <hi>Dioceſan Way,</hi> into one Political Body, for the making up the <hi>National Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> whereof the <hi>King</hi> is Head, as I have been ſpeaking; and that is, by an Act of Parliament <hi>Legitimating</hi> theſe <hi>Meetings</hi> of the <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> ſo as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thereby immediately <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> as <hi>National,</hi> no leſs than <hi>Parochial</hi> Aſſemblies. It was a good thing in the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> that they were about to free many Innocent Men from the danger of the <hi>Penal Statutes;</hi> but the making ſuch Meetings to be <hi>Legal,</hi> is a Deſign of another Nature, of a far greater, nobler, and vaſt Importance. See page 28, 29, 30, 31. To which add what he ſays, pag. 36. 'If theſe <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Aſſemblies</hi> were made <hi>Legal,</hi> the Schiſm preſently, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the National Church, were at an end. <hi>Schiſm in a Separation from that Church, whereof we ought, or are bound to be Members: If the Supreme Authority then looſe our Obligation to the Pariſh-Meeting, ſo that we are bound no longer, the</hi> Iniquity <hi>upon that account is not to be</hi> found, <hi>and the Schiſm gone.</hi> It is one Act of Parliament would give a full Anſwer to all mens Arguments.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s deſign may be eaſily gathered from theſe words, which I have thus largely tranſcribed; and ſhould our Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors favour and promote it, it would reſtore peace and quiet to a Church and State almoſt broken to pieces by diviſions, animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, fears and jealouſies: By this means the ſons of the Church might enjoy their Dignities, Preferments and Livings, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their Government and Diſcipline to be of Divine right, and exerciſe it on all that are of the ſame apprehenſion and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The Separate Congregations may enjoy their own opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning their own Government and Churches; and all might live together in love, and every one ſit under his vine and fig-tree, and none make him afraid. A cloſer union I do eaſily grant were deſirable; but I am afraid this is all that is attaina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in this Nation, yea and in the Chriſtian world (whatever
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61768:66"/>our Author may ſay to the contrary); and that thoſe that will have more, ſhall have leſs. 'Tis with Chriſtian Churches as 'tis with ſome weakly conſtituted bodies, if no violent remedies be uſed, they may drill out for many years; but if you will be tampering, and nothing will ſatisfie you but a perfect health, you will ſoon deſtroy them.</p>
            <p>If Churches that have ſome defects may be endured, God may have ſome worſhip, and we may ſee ſome peace among Chriſtians; but if like Eccleſiaſtical Mountebanks we will be perpetually trying experiments upon ſickly and diſeaſed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, we may diſturb the peace of Chriſtians, deſtroy the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and leave few to call upon the name of God in the world.</p>
            <p>What I have diſcourſed, I think may with ſome probability be expected from Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s deſign. But can we expect ſo much from the deſign of this Gentleman? Or is there the leaſt ſhadow for it? For my part I can ſee no ſuch thing; he muſt have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eyes, or worſe, than I have, that can ſee any advantage like to betide Proteſtants by uniting in a General Council, or in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch or Pope, ruling by the Canons thereof. And yet I think this is that our Author would be at. For he affirms, <hi>That it is not enough or ſufficient to Chriſtian Unity, that the Chriſtians of one Nation, or one Congregation be united among themſelves, unleſs they be united to the Catholique Church: For if there be but one Church, a whole Nation may be Schiſmatical, as well as ſingle perſons,</hi> &amp;c. Well then, I am paſt all doubt that Proteſtants will never agree to the Canons of a General Council, nor to the Government of a Patriarch or Pope according to thoſe Canons, and then they are all Schiſmaticks; and if the Princes in whoſe Dominions they live, can be prevailed withal to do it, they are to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, Baniſhed, ſent to the Galleys and Mines, or be chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at home by Axes and Halters: And I think this is a very pious and charitable Deſign, and becoming a Proteſtant Doctor, and Son of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But by the way, give me leave to add, that whereas this Gentleman hath undertaken to vindicate the Learned Dean of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> from what Mr. <hi>Humfrey</hi> hath ſaid againſt him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Conſtitutive. Head of this National <hi>Church,</hi> I am ſhrewdly afraid that he has given up the Doctor's Cauſe, and left
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:61768:66"/>it to ſhift for it ſelf as well as it can, or rather aſſerted that of his Adverſary. The Doctor had ſaid, <hi>That we deny any need of a Conſtitutive Regent part, or one Formal Eccleſiaſtical Head as eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to a National Church.</hi> This Mr. <hi>H.</hi> confutes, and this Author affirms and defends, but grants a <hi>pars imperans &amp; ſubdita,</hi> or <hi>a ruling and ruled part,</hi> p. 567. <hi>Church-Governours united, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning by conſent,</hi> ſays he, <hi>are the governing part, Chriſtian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in obedience to the Laws of our Saviour, ſubmitting to ſuch Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, are the ruled part; and all this is true without a Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive Regent Head,</hi> pag. ibid.</p>
            <p>This methinks looks ſtrange! That the Biſhops by conſent (which conſent they are obliged to by the Laws of Chriſt) ſhould be the <hi>pars imperans,</hi> and yet not the Conſtitutive Regent Head, is in my opinion a Paradox: For I would fain learn, what it is that makes a Conſtitutive Regent Head to any Body; Is it not Right and Obligation to Rule? Doth not this make Kings and Princes Conſtitutive Heads of their Principalities and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms? And doth not this make Ariſtocracies and Democracies the eſſential Regent part of thoſe Commonwealths over which they do preſide? Have the Biſhops of this Nation Right and Obligation to rule all the Chriſtian People in it? This I think our Author will grant: And how he will deny them to be the Conſtitutive Head of the National Church, with any conſiſtency of Reaſon, I do not yet underſtand.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman indeed ſays, <hi>That though a National Church be one body, yet' tis not ſuch a body as he</hi> (Mr. <hi>B.) deſcribes, nor can be according to its Original Conſtitution, which differs from Secular Forms of Government, by that ancient Church-Canon of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> It ſhall not be ſo among you. And then adds, <hi>A Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church, as governed by conſent, may be one body in an Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, though not in a Civil Political ſenſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it cannot be a Body, conſiſting of Head and Members in a Political ſenſe, according to Mr. <hi>B's.</hi> deſcription, I do not find proved by that Church-Canon of our Saviour.</p>
            <p>That the Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Forms of Government do differ, I readily grant; but are there no other Differences but ſuch as are eſſential?</p>
            <p>A Regent formal Head and Members, is of the eſſence of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical bodies, and that is no body that is without them, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61768:67"/>ever this Gentleman ſays to the contrary. Many other defects are conſiſtent with the being of Political bodies; but if they want a Head, they are no Body. The Church differs in many things from Civil Political bodies, and particularly in this, that it is not armed <hi>with civil power and juriſdiction,</hi> p. 566. by which I ſuppoſe this Author means Coercive power. But what then? Hath the Church no Conſtitutive Head, becauſe it hath no Coercive power? or becauſe it cannot impriſon, fine, and deſtroy its members? Maſters, and Parents, and Tutors, can't do theſe things, and yet moſt men think they are the Regent formal Heads of their Families, children and pupils. Well then, againſt that marvellous Oracle of our Author, <hi>That a National Church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by conſent, may be a body in an Eccleſiaſtical, tho' not in a civil political ſenſe,</hi> (i. e. tho' it may be a Church, yet it cannot be a Commonwealth or Kingdom) I will advance this propoſition, That a National Church is a body in a political ſenſe, as well as in an Eccleſiaſtical, or elſe it is no body at all; and that according to his own doctrine. And if he will defend the Deans cauſe, he muſt write a book in his own confutation, which I think he ought to do in revenge on himſelf, that he hath hitherunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed it, as the Dr. has the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>Our Author, I remember, ſomewhere calls Mr. <hi>Humfrey</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Eccho, when yet Mr. <hi>Humfrey</hi>'s Anſwer to the Drs. Book, came out before Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s. When the Eccho now can be proved to go before the Voice, or the Voice to follow the Eccho, then ſhall the Deans determination of the queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and them concerning the Conſtitutive Head of the National Church, be held as <hi>unanſwerable</hi> as this Gentleman af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it in one place, and as <hi>admirable</hi> as he cryes it up in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Having ſaid thus much on the behalf of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> I ſhall add a few lines more before I return to the vindication of the <hi>Countrey Conformiſt.</hi> The learned D. of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> had charged the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts with joining with the Papiſts for a general Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and as a proof of what he affirmed, produces ſome few paſſages from a Book written, (tho' not printed) by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> in the year 1675. and reprinted with ſome alterations 1680. Mr. <hi>Humfrey</hi> gives the reaſons of thoſe alterations, but withal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61768:67"/>that he altered not his opinion. At which our Author makes ſome exceptions (pag. 26. of his Preface), and ſeems to ſuſpect the truth of what Mr. <hi>H.</hi> had ſaid concerning the alteration of ſome lines in his Book, without altering his judgment in that caſe. Theſe are his words: <hi>He will not own that he hath altered his judgment in the ſecond Impreſſion of his book, from what it was in the firſt: but people know not mens judgments but by their words; and the words of his firſt and ſecond Edition contain a very different and contrary ſenſe, which ſhould ſuppoſe ſome altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What a ſpiteful malignant inſinuation were this, if Mr. <hi>H.</hi> were not known to be one that does not lye! He perſiſts upon the words <hi>like toleration,</hi> which after Mr. <hi>H.</hi> hath explained, is nothing but cavil, and I need no more than to repeat Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s own words for the reproof of this Gentleman, who would not have omitted <hi>theſe</hi> when he cites <hi>others,</hi> if he had dealt honeſtly by him.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Dr. thinks or ſpeaks as if the Author (in reprinting the Book) had changed his opinion; wherein I account he is moſt of all out, and moſt to blame. He who drew up the Book, is not one of that humour, as to turn with the times, but rather againſt them. The opinion he offered in the year —75. is the ſame that he holds now in the year —80. Here is an alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on indeed, as to more words, or ſome other words, but the ſame opinion, or ſolution, with the difference only of a further explication of it, and nothing therein (beſides avoiding offence) intended. The Author had been wary in declaring the Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration he propoſed, to be a limited one, and provided againſt the Jeſuit upon reaſon of State, and ſhewed his dread of Popery in dominion, but had omitted the diſtinction of a toleration, in regard to <hi>publick</hi> Aſſemblies, and the <hi>private</hi> exerciſe of a mans Religion. He explains himſelf therefore by way of ſupply, ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that what he ſaid at firſt, ſhould be taken in regard to the tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Papiſt only <hi>privately,</hi> as his meaning really was then, and is now but fuller expreſſed. This is the opinion he recedes not from (whether peculiar to himſelf, or not) <hi>that no man ſhould be perſecuted meerly for his conſcience, if there be no other reaſon.</hi> Whether he be a <hi>Diſſenter</hi> of one kind, or other, <hi>the common rule of Chriſtianity muſt be remembred</hi> (he ſays) <hi>ſtill, that we do
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61768:68"/>by all men as we would be done by, and that with what meaſure we mete to others, it ſhall be meaſured to us again.</hi>
               </q> Theſe words are in all the Impreſſions.</p>
            <p>And to this purpoſe I cannot but note what I find in Mr. <hi>B's.</hi> 2 <hi>l Def. p.</hi> 16, who after he hath ſpoken of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as a man of known <hi>Latitude,</hi> and <hi>Univerſal Charity, and diſcountenancing Cruelty,</hi> adds concerning himſelf; <hi>And I ſo little fear the noiſe of the Cenſorious, that even now, while tht Plot doth render them moſt odious, I freely ſay;</hi> 1. <hi>That I would have Papiſts uſed like men, and no worſe than our own Defence requireth.</hi> 2. <hi>That I would have no man put to death for being a Prieſt.</hi> 3. <hi>I would not have them by any Law compelled to our Communion and Sacraments.</hi> Nor can a man think but the Reverend Dean of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> himſelf had alſo ſome Compaſſion, Pity and Kindneſs for them, when he condemns ſuch <hi>Heats, as tranſport men beyond the juſt bounds of Prudence, Decency and Humanity towards their greateſt Enemies,</hi> Pref. pag. 34. And whereas this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man objects, <hi>That the alteration was not made in Mr.</hi> H's <hi>Book till five years after,</hi> I hope there is a good reaſon for it, becauſe it was ſo many years before the ſecond Impreſſion: and I know not by what means it could be altered till the Book was Printed a ſecond time.</p>
            <p>I return now to the <hi>Countrey Conformiſt.</hi> The Doctor had ſaid in his <hi>Pref. pag.</hi> 78. upon the Principles of ſome of our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Brethren, Let the Conſtitution be made never ſo eaſie to themſelves, yet others may make uſe of their grounds, and carry on their differences as high as ever. To which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt had ſaid, There was no doubt but inſufferable Hereticks might pretend Conſcience and many other things for Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, as well as modeſt and tolerable Diſſenters; but that he thought there was no reaſon that they ſhould have the ſame Conceſſions; and that he hoped our Governours would be able to diſtinguiſh between thoſe that erre in ſmall things, and thoſe that ſubvert the Chriſtian Religion. This Anſwer doth not ſatisfie our Author, who enquires, (pag. 8.) <hi>But in the mean time, how doth he anſwer the Deans Argument, that it is not the way to Peace, and Union, and to ſilence Differences?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I ſhould reply to this Gentleman in other words, and give him another Anſwer, peradventure he may be unſatisfied, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61768:68"/>ask the ſame Queſtion again: However I'll venture this once. Many of the Diſſenters from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> are ſound in their Judgments, and agree with us in all the great Eſſentials of the Chriſtian Religion, and in moſt of the Integrals alſo; theſe would gladly incorporate with us, but that there are ſome Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions that they cannot ſubmit unto; now certainly if theſe things which are the reaſon and cauſe of the Difference between them and their Brethren were removed, the difference were at an end. Others there are that are men of ſound Judgments in the main Articles of the Chriſtian Religion, but cannot incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate with us in the National <hi>Church;</hi> if theſe were Legally indulged, they would be free from fear, their minds would be at reſt; amidſt variety of Judgments and Practices, we might live together in Love and Peace. And thus I think I have told this Gentleman, how many of our differences may be ended, and how thoſe that cannot be ended, may yet be laid to ſleep, and perſons made amicable and friendly. As for intolerable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, I ſhall not be their Patron, only I would have them uſed like men, and that nothing be done to them that is unworthy of the Chriſtian Religion, which is made up in great part of Love, Kindneſs and Compaſſion: And if thus much Union and Peace will not ſatisfie this Author, I ſuppoſe he may look for it in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but I doubt that he will hardly find it in this world. I am of opinion, that a ceſſation of Differences among Chriſtians and Churches, and a total ceſſation of ſin, will appear at the ſame inſtant. I do ſomtimes admire, that thoſe that never expect to ſee the one upon Earth, but are very calm and patient without it, ſhould ſo paſſionately deſire the other, that they can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to move Heaven and Earth for the obtaining of it. What <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaid of particular perſons, I ſay of Churches, <hi>Optimus eſt qui minimis urgetur vitiis;</hi> He is the beſt man that hath leaſt faults, and there are none without them. Thoſe are the beſt <hi>Churches</hi> which have the leaſt of defects and imperfections; ſuch as are without fault are not to be found out of Heaven. And as among men, the ſtrong muſt bear the Infirmities of the weak; ſo among Churches, the ſtrongeſt and moſt perfect muſt bear the Weakneſs and Infirmities of thoſe that are more defective and imperfect. If our Author ſhould ſay, that thoſe that I plead for and call <hi>Churches,</hi> are no <hi>Churches,</hi> but acompany of Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61768:69"/>Conventicles; I anſwer, I am of opinion, that they are as truly <hi>Churches,</hi> and parts of this National <hi>Church</hi> (or may be eaſily ſo made) as the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>France, Holland, Geneva, Switzerland,</hi> &amp;c. are of the Univerſal: But if our Author ſhall pleaſe to cut them off from the Catholique (as I think according to his own Doctrine he muſt do) I ſhall permit him the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty (for I know not how to hinder it) to cut off theſe from the National <hi>Church,</hi> having no mind at this time to debate the Juſtice of his Sentence. Only I will beg leave to tell him, that I can by no means believe, that what he doth on Earth will be ratified in Heaven; or that God will damn all that he gives up to the Devil.</p>
            <p>If what hath been ſaid doth not ſatisfie our Gentleman; give me leave to ſuppoſe him a Miniſter of the Reformed Church in <hi>France,</hi> be it at <hi>Charenton, Caen, Saumur,</hi> or where you pleaſe, and let me ſuppoſe that ſome Gentlemen of the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion addreſs themſelves to him after this manner: Sir, We pity your ſtate and condition, and have a kindneſs for you, (for though you be an Heretick, you are one of human race) the King our Maſter will have but one Religion in his Kingdom, and you muſt comply with him, or elſe you are undone; your Eſtate, your Liberty, and peradventure your Life muſt all be ſacrificed to him, for he is reſolved, and peremptory in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; all muſt ſerve God the ſame way, or they muſt bear the puniſhment of refuſing it: Here are the Subſcriptions that are made by the Catholick Clergy, do but ſet your hand to them, and you're ſafe, and may ſhare with them in the Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this our Author anſwers; Gentlemen, I bear an honour to our Puiſſant and Invincible Monarch, and am very ready to obey all his juſt commands; but in this particular I pray you have me excuſed, God is a King ſuperiour to our Prince, and muſt be obeyed before him. I fear His Majeſties Diſpleaſure and Vengeance, but I am much more afraid of that, of God; the one may hang or break me upon the wheel, but the other will damn me for evermore. I beſeech you therefore interpoſe with his Majeſty on the behalf of me and my Brethren, that we may have the ſame liberty of worſhipping God, as for many years paſt we have enjoyed under him and his Royal Predeceſſors;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61768:69"/>We vow all Duty and Allegiance to his Perſon and Government; we will defend them with our Lives and Fortunes; and we have nothing ſo dear to us (unleſs it be our Conſciences) which we are not willing to ſacrifice for his juſt Honour and Advantage. The Subſcription you propoſe I cannot make, without the offence of God and my Conſcience: And I muſt beg his Majeſties Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, if I chuſe to obey the God of Heaven, before his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent here on earth.</p>
            <p>The Catholick Gentlemen replies, His Majeſty is willing and reſolved to put an end to all Differences and Controverſies in Religion, he is weary of thoſe eternal Squabbles that are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by Divines of different perſwaſions. The Temple of <hi>Janus</hi> ſhall be ſhut, he will have no more Religious Wars among his Subjects. To grant you the Liberty of ſerving God after your own Way, is not a method of ending Differences, but of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuating them: For when you are pleaſed, others may ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to you, and under pretence of Conſcience carry on Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences as high as ever.</p>
            <p>Let our Author anſwer the Argument of theſe Catholick <hi>Meſſieurs,</hi> and I do humbly conceive I may be able from his own words to anſwer that of the Doctor, if it be not ſufficiently done already: but let him not miſunderſtand or pervert my words. I do not affirm that the Impoſitions in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> are equally wicked, burdenſome and offenſive; all that I ſay is, they are both unlawful in the judgment of thoſe that do refuſe them: and the Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt relaxing thoſe Impoſitions, or granting Liberty to thoſe that do refuſe them, are the ſame, and muſt receive the ſame Anſwers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 9. The <hi>Conformiſt</hi> had ſaid, That he hoped our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours would diſtinguiſh between thoſe that ſubvert the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith, and thoſe that err in ſmall things. Our Gentleman an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers: <hi>Thus our Governours have diſtinguiſhed already, and yet it hath not put an end to our Controverſies; nor is he</hi> (the Conformiſt) <hi>ſure that once more diſtinguiſhing will do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply, That when and where our Governours have made this diſtinction, I confeſs the <hi>Countrey Conformiſt</hi> is as ignorant as our Author will needs have him <hi>in the Conſtitution of our Church,</hi> p. 10. What particular perſons may have done,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61768:70"/>I do not enquire; but what the Governours of our Church have done. They have determined the conditions of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and upon what terms the Clergy may miniſter at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; but where by any publick act they have diſtinguiſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the great eſſentials of the Chriſtian Religion which muſt be believed, and leſſer errors that may be tolerated, I do not know, and cannot find. If this Gentleman thinks that all things impoſed as conditions of Communion either upon Laity or Clergy in <hi>England,</hi> are of the eſſence of Chriſtianity, and that all who have other apprehenſions concerning them, are damnable Hereticks, let him enjoy his Faith to himſelf, I am not like to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his proſelyte, nor I think many others.</p>
            <p>P. 10. Our Author proceeds; <hi>Will not the excluded parties cry as loud for Liberty of Conſcience, and complain of perſecution, as they do now? Either theſe are good arguments, or they are not? If they be, they will hold good in all caſes, that men muſt not ſuffer for their conſciences, but be allowed the free exerciſe of their Religion accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their own perſuaſions. If they be not, let them leave off the pretences of ſcruples and tender conſciences, with that liberty and freedom in exerciſing their Religion which they challenge as their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural birthright, and demand no more of that, than what the merit of their Cauſe requires.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this diſcourſe there are more ſtrange things than one.
<list>
                  <item>1. He declares, that if thoſe arguments that are brought for free ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Religion, from ſcruple, and tenderneſs of Conſcience, be good, they muſt be good in all caſes. The meaning is this, One man doubts, whether it be lawful to uſe a Form of Prayer, another whether it be lawful to take the Sacrament kneeling, and the like. Now from theſe things therefore they plead for ſome condeſcentions. But no, ſaith our Author, if we humor and indulge you in this ſcruple, we muſt do the like by ſuch as doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jeſus Chriſt be the Saviour of the world: for if the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from ſcruple of Conſcience, be good in one caſe, 'tis good in all caſes.</item>
                  <item>2. He ſuppoſes their arguments may not be good; and what muſt they do then? Why, they muſt leave off their <hi>pretences of ſcruple,</hi> and <hi>demand no more than the merit of their Cauſe requires.</hi> But what is this? Doth their Cauſe deſerve ſome liberty and indulgence, tho' the reaſons they plead for it, be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth? This I confeſs looks to me unaccountable.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61768:70"/>I have been always apt to think, that the merits of a Cauſe were neither more nor leſs than the reaſons that might be produced in favour of it. But cheer up <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> if you will but lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide all claim to indulgence, and ſay, you have no reaſon to claim any, you may have it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> lb. Our Gentleman proceeds. <hi>As for what he</hi> (the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Conformiſt) <hi>adds about the difference between ſubverting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and ſome ſmaller errors, as a juſt foundation for liberty, or reſtraint: Suppoſe our Governors ſhould think Schiſm as deſtructive to Religion, and the ſouls of men, as many hereſies are, it would be an unreaſonable thing to deſire them to eſtabliſh Schiſm by a Law; and yet if they did ſo, they would not be much miſtaken in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer: The <hi>Countrey Conformiſt</hi> did ſay, that the difference between ſubverting Religion, and ſome ſmaller errors, is a juſt foundation for liberty and reſtraint; and I know nothing this Author hath ſaid in prejudice thereunto. Either all men of differing judgments and apprehenſions muſt have liberty, or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome. If all, then is this Gentleman a greater Patron for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty than I. If only ſome, then muſt they be diſtinguiſhed by the opinions in which they differ, which is that Aſſertion the <hi>Countrey Conformiſt</hi> lays down.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, That no difference in opinions muſt be tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then no man muſt be endured: for I much doubt whether there be any two men in the world that are in all things of the ſame mind; and ſo every man's hand will be againſt every man, and the Chriſtian world will be a field of blood.</p>
            <p>As to what our Author ſays in the next paragraph, (p. 11, 12.) of the <hi>Countrey Conformiſt</hi>'s Ignorance and Enmity to the <hi>Church,</hi> Partiality to Diſſenters, his charging the Dr. with haughtineſs, and apologizing for the rude and barbarous treating of an excellent perſon without provocation, I reply. The <hi>Countrey Conformiſt</hi> upon my knowledg is not ignorant of the Conſtitution of our Church; nor is he any Enemy to any thing in it, but its imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and the pertinacity of thoſe Church-men that do in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing defend it, and avow nothing in it needing Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He hath no prejudice againſt the Dean, nor partiality for his Adverſaries, any further than he conceives the D.'s Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to have truth and right on their ſide, and him to be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. That the D. hath treated the Diſſenters ſeverely in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61768:71"/>and his Adverſaries with haughtineſs and contempt in his Book, is not only the opinion of the <hi>Countrey Conformiſt,</hi> but the <hi>ſorrow</hi> of many others who are no enemies to him. He hath made no Apology for any thing that is rude and barbarous in the D's Adverſaries (for where that is, he doth not find): He hath only endeavoured to put a true and candid interpretation upon what was otherwiſe liable to be miſunderſtood.</p>
            <p>To the next paragraph (p. 13.) I ſhall need to ſay nothing, ſeeing the Gentleman does confeſs that the paſſage quoted by the <hi>Countrey Conformiſt</hi> out of the Dean's Sermon was <hi>ſharp.</hi> And foraſmuch as he is brought to this, I am not for that <hi>diverting entertainment</hi> he would give me, in the enquiry <hi>what uſage the Dr. hath met with</hi> (from Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Mr. <hi>A.</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi>) <hi>upon ſo little provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> as he accounts. There is one paſſage only in reference to the <hi>Countrey Conformiſt</hi>'s Apology for Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> as to his way of writing, that I muſt not paſs over. <hi>If men</hi> (ſays he) <hi>revile and reproach without ſpite and anger, as much as other men can do with it; if a quick and earneſt temper of mind, and keen and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſtile, make a man guilty of as unjuſt cenſures and opprobrious reflections as the moſt invenom'd ſpirit, what ſatisfaction is this to the injured perſon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply: How a man can revile and reproach without ſpite or anger, I confeſs I cannot tell. Our Saviour ſays, <hi>Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh;</hi> but how a man may ſpeak plain Engliſh without either one or the other of theſe, and with no <hi>invenomed ſpirit</hi> at all, I can tell; and that is to ſpeak out of love and zeal to peace, and for the vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the innocent and depreſſed. And thus I hope have I, and Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Humfrey</hi> ſpoken, notwithſtanding the ſix next pages which are ſpent in expoſing ſome bare expreſſions of Mr. <hi>Humfrey</hi> (whom he hath alſo named, when he put not his name to his Book) without ſerving any end but the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, upon my ſaying that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> had done Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and the Dr. both right, in praiſing the one, and rebuking the other. Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s <hi>rebukes</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I confeſs are plain, how modeſt let others judg by a peruſal of ſome of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here he runs out ſix pages in citations. In anſwer to all which, I ſhall only make him this payment. <hi>He hath cited,</hi> I
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61768:71"/>will <hi>recite</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s expreſſions. He hath done nothing but cite them, to ſlur him: I ſhall need nothing but recite them for my <hi>own,</hi> and <hi>his</hi> full vindication.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Doctor is one who may look on himſelf to have Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in ſome regard, which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath not: But if he ſhould really value himſelf with Mr. <hi>B.</hi> upon the account of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Divine, he is a man who muſt want that Modeſty <hi>in good earneſt,</hi> whereof he makes a ſhew in the beginning of his Book, upon a compariſon of his with Biſhop <hi>Jewell.</hi> The Doctor hath his excellencies other ways, but he hath not Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. The Doctor's Soul is made of Free-ſtone, you ſhall have from him <hi>poliſhed Learning.</hi> Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s is made of Flint, you ſhall have from him <hi>acute Truth.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> (I will ſay) is one, like the man in the Neighbourhood who is firſt up, and all the Neighbours come for fire to his houſe; that is, a man indeed <hi>extraordinary.</hi> From whom the preſent Age do fetch <hi>Light,</hi> and unto whom the Ages to come will bring <hi>Honour.</hi> Above all, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is a holy man, who will be for ever greater in his once <hi>refuſing</hi> a Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, than the Doctor can be in <hi>getting</hi> one, if the preſent ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>managing this Cauſe doth not preclude his having any.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of Mr <hi>H</hi>'s expreſſions, and of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and which in my opinion, are <hi>weighed</hi> as well as <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</hi> I ſhall only add on mine own part thoſe few words of the Apoſtle, <hi>This witneſs is true.</hi> And ſeeing I have quoted ſo much of that Learned mans words, in point of <hi>equal judging;</hi> I will not forbear the end of his Book, in point of <hi>upright dealing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The Dr. had no need to lay out his parts upon ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign as that he hath under his hands; nor hath he reaſon to <hi>deſpiſe</hi> or <hi>ſcorn,</hi> no nor to <hi>ſlight</hi> or <hi>neglect</hi> the meaneſt perſon. For I muſt confeſs, 'tis matter of real offence to me, that a perſon who is ſo <hi>learned</hi> a man, ſo <hi>honoured</hi> a man throughout the Nation, ſhould prove a <hi>proud man,</hi> a <hi>diſdainful perſon;</hi> which temper if it be indulged, is ſo unendurable by God and man, that it will hurl any man into the duſt. And I cannot do any better ſervice in the earth to this otherwiſe very much worthy, and excellent Doctor, than to contribute the beſt I can to my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, for the bringing him to ſome ingenuous ſenſe and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy Brother in thy heart; but thou

Not I count for the merits of the Controverſie, which is not to be expected from a Conformiſt, but for the ingenuity of Spirit which he hath ſhewn in ſo ſingular exemplary a charity towards the Diſſenter, and (what I count more peculiar) in ſuch a true candid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Doctor, even while he takes ſo natural a freedom as he does with him, that the <hi>fawning</hi> (for ſo is applauſe to the riſing) of <hi>this Authour,</hi> is but alchimy to <hi>his reprehenſion.</hi> I am beholding I muſt confeſs to the Gentleman for my own part for his <hi>Reflections,</hi> but I muſt commend his <hi>Additional Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks.</hi> I will commend them particularly to the Deans Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, not for an <hi>Anſwer,</hi> but for his imitation. I do apprehend that in the writing his firſt ſheets, he was not ſo well aware of their being Printed as he was of the other, and that, that was the reaſon of the difference of the ſtyle in regard to the Doctor. It is a kindneſs this worthy good man hath done me by laying in a cenſure of my ſheets before hand, and ſo prevented the ſugil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of this Author. As I need not therefore, ſo I ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear any retortions of that kind, and addreſs my ſelf to my little task before me.</p>
            <p>It begins, page 557. To <hi>State</hi> this matter, and to lay a <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> for an Anſwer to the Queſtion <hi>what the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>is, and who is the Conſtitutive Regent part of it,</hi> he diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes <hi>between a National Church conſidered as a Church, and as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated in the State</hi> (p. 558.) and then ſpeaks to both.</p>
            <pb n="130" facs="tcp:61768:73"/>
            <p>For this diſtinction, if he had ſaid the <hi>Church of Chriſt</hi> may be conſidered <hi>in its ſelf,</hi> and as <hi>incorporated in the State,</hi> it had been a good diſtinction, but to ſay the <hi>National</hi> Church may have this double conſideration, it is not good, becauſe the Church is <hi>National</hi> onely under the laſt conſideration. The Church of Chriſt conſidered <hi>in its ſelf</hi> is either <hi>Univerſal</hi> or <hi>Particular,</hi> but it muſt be conſidered as <hi>incorporated in the State</hi> to make it <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</hi> This quick Antagoniſt hath the ſagacity to perceive this, and therefore cites theſe words of mine, page 559. <q>To be Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular or Univerſal is Eſſential to Chriſts Church, but to be National is of Accidental conſideration.</q> 
               <hi>If this be true</hi> (now ſays he) <hi>then is my diſtinction</hi> (that is this diſtinction) <hi>quite out of doors, for it is a Church</hi> (that is a National Church) <hi>as it is the State</hi> (as it is in the State, he ſhould ſay,) <hi>and Headed by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magiſtrate.</hi> This is well, and what hath he then to object againſt me, and to ſay for himſelf?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Againſt me,</hi> he ſays, <hi>There are two things</hi> (p. 560.) <hi>ſuppoſed in my Argument</hi> (which he hath candidly delivered) <hi>as neceſſary to the being of a National Church that are not neceſſary, That all the people</hi> (that is the generality) <hi>of the Nation ſhould be Chriſtian, and that the King ſhould be ſo alſo.</hi> Theſe two things, I had ſaid, were Accidental to the Church of Chriſt, and yet goe to the making our Church <hi>National,</hi> and conſequently the Church of Chriſt is National onely under an <hi>Accidental</hi> conſideration. But theſe two things he Objects are not to be ſuppoſed neceſſary to a National Church. I anſwer, when we ſpeak of a National Church, our owne is always to be underſtood, about which the diſpute is, and our Church is a National Political Church, no otherwiſe but upon this account, and the <hi>ſuppoſition</hi> hereof is <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For himſelf,</hi> he ſays, <hi>There were great Combinations before</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine's <hi>days Patriarchal, Metropolitan, which are of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with what we call National Churches.</hi> I Anſwer, A <hi>Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal</hi> Church, and a <hi>Metropolitan</hi> Church is not a Church <hi>Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi> A Patriarchate may contain in it the Chriſtians of <hi>many</hi> Nations, A Metropolitan but <hi>half</hi> the Chriſtians of <hi>one,</hi> and ſo the one is too big, and the other too little to be a National Church, and a Dioceſan much leſs. By a National Church we commonly underſtand (I apprehend) a Political Church
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61768:73"/>wherein all the particular Chriſtians and Churches in a Nation, and theſe only, are combined under one Government, through the Supream Magiſtrate, to Church purpoſes. A Metropolitan Church is no combination of them <hi>all,</hi> and a Patriarchal a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of <hi>more</hi> then all. The one and the other may be called <hi>Churches,</hi> but neither one or other a <hi>National</hi> Church, which he himſelf <hi>takes</hi> to be ſuch a <hi>Union.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he <hi>cannot tell</hi> (he ſays p. 561.) why it is Accidental to the Church of Chriſt to be <hi>National</hi> any more then to be <hi>Univerſal</hi> or <hi>Patriarchal</hi> and <hi>Metropolitical</hi> any more then Univerſal: but when I <hi>tell him</hi> that the Body of Chriſt (which is his Church) may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt though there were never a Patriarch or Metropolitan in the Earth, I hope he can ſee (if he will) how the conſideration of the Church as <hi>Patriarchal</hi> or <hi>Metropolitical,</hi> and ſo <hi>National,</hi> muſt be Accidental to it. And as for Chriſts command of planting Churches (p. 16.) in the whole world, and ſo in Nations, and Cities, and Towns, requiring Unity and Communion every where among Chriſtians, it may warrant the Combinations of Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal, Metropolitical, National, Dioceſan, and Parochial Churches to this end, if he pleaſe, provided only, that theſe forms be held <hi>Accidental forms</hi> according to <hi>humane</hi> prudence, and not the <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential form</hi> of the Church of Chriſt according to <hi>divine inſtitution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the queſtion whether a National Church be Political, he offers ſomething (p. 562.) and ſays the Dean in his Opinion hath anſwered with <hi>great Judgment</hi> in his denying <hi>any neceſſity of a Conſtitutive Regent part to be Eſſential to a National Church.</hi> But I will make it appear, that either the Dean or his Defender, do ſpeak here with <hi>little Judgment.</hi> It is the Notion this Author hath propoſed to publick conſideration, that the Biſhops in every Nation are to Govern the Church by conſent, that is as Collea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, <hi>per litteras formatas</hi> when they convene not, and when they do by their Canons in a Convocation. This he makes through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Book to be of Chriſts appointment, holding Epiſcopacy to be <hi>Jure Divino</hi> with others of his party. If this then be true, this Author hath found out a <hi>Conſtitutive Regent part,</hi> yea an <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical</hi> Conſtitutive Regent part of the Church in every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where there are Chriſtians, and Biſhops. And when he hath found out a Head for the Doctor, how can he thus applaud the Doctors anſwer, that denies the Church to have one, or ſayes,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61768:74"/>
               <hi>there is no neceſſity of any.</hi> When he does prove it to be a Church Political, and the Doctors anſwer includes a denyal of it to be ſo, how comes this man to be ſo full of reverence here with theſe words in his mouth? <hi>To this the Dean anſwers, in my poor Opinion, with great Judgment and Conſideration.</hi> It is with great Judgment indeed, is it not, that the Dean hath given up the Cauſe of the Biſhops? And with great Judgment, is it not, that this man hath aſſumed the Prerogative of the King to their Colledge? Let him take heed leaſt he bring himſelf into queſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Many Churches Aſſociated for mutual help and concord, are a Church only in a looſe ſenſe; but thoſe that are conſtituted of one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and ſubdite part, are Churches in a Political proper ſenſe. It is no body Political without one common Governour Monarchical, Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, or Democratical.</hi> Thus ſays Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> (p. 563.) Unto which ſays this Author, <hi>Herein does his ſtrength</hi> (p. 564.) <hi>conſiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I acknowledge it does, and what hath he to <hi>weaken</hi> it? I will Tranſcribe what he ſays: <q>If we deny this, that though a National Church be one body, yet it is not ſuch a Political body as he deſcribes, (which differs from ſecular forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by that ancient Canon of our Saviour, <hi>It ſhall not be ſo among you</hi>) the controverſie may be at an end, and a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church may be one body in an Eccleſiaſtical, though not in a Civil Political ſenſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the help the Dean muſt expect from his Defender, and if the Doctor be not aſhamed of his own anſwer for this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe ſake, I know not what ſhould put any man to ſhame. This man tells me in his Preface, he <hi>will interpoſe between the Dean and ſhame in this Controverſie.</hi> Upon this account therefore I will take leave to tell him, that he does here manifeſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray a raw ignorance which ought to ſhame him. He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the term <hi>Political</hi> to be Commenſurate with <hi>Civil;</hi> as if a Government <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> could not be Political, as well as a Government <hi>Civil;</hi> that is, as if a <hi>Church</hi> could not be <hi>Political</hi> as well as other <hi>Societies.</hi> He does yet diſcover the ſame more then by words; for he hath found out a Head for the Church which is <hi>Ariſtocratical,</hi> and yet thinks the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>Political,</hi> unleſs it have ſome Head that is <hi>Perſonal:</hi> or as if a Head <hi>Collective</hi> were not <hi>One</hi> Head, as vvell as one that is <hi>Monarchical.</hi> This man vvho hath interpoſed betvveen ſhame
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61768:74"/>and the Doctor, muſt take ſhame upon him, ſeeing he calls upon me <hi>to do my part honeſtly,</hi> in the ſame place. I ſay this man hath found an Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutive Head of the Church, and that of Chriſts own Inſtitution, if he underſtands what he drives at; and yet he and the Doctor will not allow the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be Political. I will adviſe him to conſult with Biſhop <hi>Gunning,</hi> and the excellently learned, and yet humble Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> who are living, ſeeing he hath not taken his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from <hi>Bramhal,</hi> or any other who are dead, (as I conjecture) that he may be inſtructed better, before we hear any more from him.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> indeed underſtands himſelf throughly, and tells us <hi>Aſſociation of Churches for Concord (gratia Unitatis,) are no proper Churches:</hi> But an <hi>United Colledg of Biſhops for government (gratia Regiminis</hi>) is a formal Eccleſiaſtical Head, about which was the Original Queſtion. And this, this bold, and herein but half informed Author (who will interpoſe between ſhame and the Doctor) doth not underſtand neither, and as ſoon as he hath read this, will he own the ſhame he hath taken upon him? Above all, is there any man (unleſs ſo forward a one) would ever have produced that ſaying of our Saviour, <hi>If ſhall not be ſo among you,</hi> for the proving a National Church to have no Head, or that the Churches of Chriſt muſt not therefore be Political? I ſhall not be blamed I hope therefore if I ſay now again what I ſaid to the Doctor; That if this man be not aſhamed for himſelf and the Doctor, I muſt be aſhamed for them both. If we deny this (ſays he) the Controverſie were at an end: Well, but when it cannot be denyed, we muſt look farther.</p>
            <p>P. 565. <hi>We grant</hi> (ſays he) <hi>a National Church is a Political So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; for Government by conſent without Superiority is Government. I grant too Church Governours united and governing by conſent are the</hi> Pars Imperans, <hi>and the people ſubmitting to ſuch Government in obedience to the Commands of our Saviour, are the</hi> Pars Subdita, <hi>and all this is true without a conſtitutive Kegent Head.</hi> I Anſwer, if he grants (or rather aſſerts) thus much, <hi>a Government by conſent,</hi> underſtanding by it the Epiſcopal Colledg, or <hi>Cyprians One E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy</hi> as the <hi>Governing</hi> part, and the People by the Law of Chriſt <hi>ſubdite</hi> to it, then hath he found out a Conſtitutive Head, and an Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutive Head by Chriſts Inſtitution:
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61768:75"/>and to ſay that <hi>all this is true without one,</hi> is to me a perfect contradiction.</p>
            <p>When he goes on then (p. 566.) to prove that <hi>this is all, that is, or can be required to make a National Church One,</hi> by two Arguments, I anſwer, If there be <hi>ſo much as this</hi> indeed <hi>required,</hi> his two Arguments muſt prove it not onely to be <hi>One,</hi> but one <hi>Political</hi> proper Church with an Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Conſtitutive</hi> Regent part to it. <hi>The Biſhops</hi> (he ſays) <hi>have equal power</hi> by Chriſts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, <hi>and rule not by Superiority, but by Conſent,</hi> that is not by Superiority <hi>over one another,</hi> but they do rule by a <hi>Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> (I hope) <hi>over the people,</hi> and that is an <hi>Ariſtocratical</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: and when the People do <hi>conſent to Unite in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them,</hi> this makes them Members (he ſays) of that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical body: And theſe are his two reaſons (p. 566, and 567.) which need no other Animadverſion, but this notice of them. The great queſtions onely are whether this indeed be the will of Chriſt, that the Catholick, and ſo every National Church (as he ſtates the matter) ſhould be ruled by theſe Biſhops as Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues, that is by a <hi>Government</hi> (as he calls it) <hi>by conſent,</hi> and if it be, how it ſhould come to paſs that we have not in <hi>England</hi> ſuch a Government, where there is for certain no ſuch Rule <hi>by conſent</hi> of the Colledg <hi>without a Superiority,</hi> but <hi>by a Superiority</hi> (or a Supremacy) of the King, who is the Head of theſe Biſhops themſelves, as well as the Nation. This I make not my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</p>
            <p>P. 568. He hath four things for the ſtrengthning the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Mintage, and then concludes that <hi>if Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>can give him one reaſon why this may not be called one Church, or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Body Politick without a Conſtitutive. Regent part, he will think farther of it.</hi> To which I anſwer; and tell him preſently why this cannot be called one Church or Eccleſiaſtical Body Politick <hi>without</hi> a Conſtitutive Regent part, the reaſon is, becauſe it is a Body Politick Eccleſiaſtical <hi>with</hi> a Conſtitutive Regent part; and ſo he need <hi>think no farther of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Anſwer being of another nature then that which he fancies like to be made him in the next page (p. 569.) I need ſay nothing to that, nor the next (p. 570.) but come on to p. 571. for now he hath <hi>prepared the way,</hi> as he ſays, to <hi>juſtify</hi> the Doctor. Well, where there is a Political Church ſays
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61768:75"/>Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> there muſt be a Conſtitutive Head. The Doctor anſwers, there may be <hi>the true notion of a Church</hi> without one. I Reply, This is a coming off, but the queſtion indeed at the bottome, is, whether it be the <hi>true notion</hi> of the <hi>Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</p>
            <p>The Doctor argues, <hi>If it be neceſſary that every Church muſt have a Conſtitutive Regent part as eſſential to it, then it unavoidably follows, that there muſt be a Catholick Viſible Head to the Church Catholick Viſible.</hi> This Argument the Deans Defender thinks <hi>unanſwerable.</hi> But we reply, the Argument is ſuch, as <hi>needs no Anſwer,</hi> and it may <hi>eaſily be Anſwered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt place it needs no Anſwer, becauſe the thing it would prove, is but what we can grant him; that is, a <hi>Viſible Head</hi> to the <hi>Catholick Church. Chriſt</hi> is that <hi>Head</hi> we ſay, and he is <hi>Viſible.</hi> When he was on earth he gave Laws for his Church, and Commiſſionated Officers, which are <hi>Rights</hi> of a Head; He after appeared to <hi>Paul,</hi> and Commiſſionated him, and is now Viſible in Heaven. This is plain proof in Reaſon, Senſe and Scripture, and not to be jeered off, and therefore in the <hi>firſt place</hi> the Doctors Argument <hi>needs no Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place we ſay farther, <hi>it is eaſily Anſwered;</hi> for we deny the Argument. <hi>If it be neceſſary for a Church to have a Conſtitutive Head,</hi> it follows that the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> muſt have a <hi>Conſtitutive one:</hi> but it follows not that it muſt have a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Viſible Head</hi> or that, that <hi>Conſtitutive</hi> Head muſt be <hi>Viſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This in truth is introducing four Terms into the Argument which we know is falſe Arguing. When there is put more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the thing Aſſerted in the Conſequence, then there is to prove it in the Antecedent in an Hypothetical Syllogiſme, it is all one as to argue with four terms in a Syllogiſm that is Categorical. But the Doctor (ſays he) puts more ſtrength in it. <hi>The queſtion is about the Catholick Church, whereof particular Churches are parts, and they being Viſible do require the Conſtitutive Regent part to be Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</hi> I Anſwer, though here be more <hi>words,</hi> here is no more <hi>ſtrength</hi> put into the Argument, I ſtill deny the Conſequence. For though the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church conſiſts of <hi>Particular</hi> Churches which are <hi>Viſible,</hi> it conſiſts alſo of that <hi>ſociety in heaven</hi> which is <hi>not Viſible,</hi> Chriſts Body is but one Body, whereof part is <hi>in Heaven,</hi> and part <hi>on Earth,</hi> and while the Head is in Heaven,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61768:76"/>it follows not, that becauſe part of the Body is Viſible, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Head muſt be Viſible. It is all one as if he ſhould ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thus. Particular Churches are <hi>on Earth,</hi> and if Chriſt be Head of the Catholick Church whereof they are parts, he muſt not be <hi>in Heaven.</hi> And when indeed this is one and the ſame Argument, and we know it to be falſe, we do juſtly deny the Doctors Argument. Suppoſe a man ſo high as that his head reached above the clouds, will you argue, that this perſon hath no head, becauſe his head is not viſible? I deny the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>There is really nothing hard in the Doctors Argument, but to underſtand why his Defender (whom I value for his Parts) ſhould come to think it <hi>unanſwerable.</hi> It may be the Doctors confident word at firſt, <hi>[it undenyably follows]</hi> drew on this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, and he hath fetcht the Argument over ſo long, till he hath put enough in it, to make himſelf believe it. <hi>We are far</hi> (ſays he) <hi>from aſſerting that the Univerſal Head muſt be Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble if the Subordinate be ſo</hi> (he ſhould be as far from aſſerting the Head to be Viſible, becauſe Particular Churches or the Members are ſo:) <hi>but this we aſſert, that if no Church can be a true Viſible Church without a Subordinate Viſible Head, then the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Church cannot be a Viſible Church without a Subordinate Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Viſible Head,</hi> p. 574, 575, 576. This he takes to be the Doctors Argument, and he will make the conſequence hold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he has done with it. But againſt whom does the Doctor and this man argue? Is it not againſt Mr. <hi>Bexter?</hi> and did Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ever ſay this, that there can be no true Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>Subordinate Head under Chriſt?</hi> Is not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant as well as the Doctor, and do they not both maintain the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> to have one onely <hi>Supreme Head</hi> and no <hi>Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate</hi> one in Earth? If his Defender hath found out one who is not the Pope, but the Colledge of Biſhops, I deſire Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> to appear above board, and to let us know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will ſet up alſo for that notion, and defend his Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is a man who underſtood Politicks, and ſtated what he underſtood, but the Doctor was (at the preſent) raw, and put into his arguing he did not know well what (that is the truth on't,) and foraſmuch as this man hath undertaken to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61768:76"/>
               <hi>interpoſe between ſhame and the Doctor.</hi> I will tell them both plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Doctor may be aſhamed to put in a fourth Term into his Argument, and this man truly takes the ſhame on him, by bringing in a fifth alſo. That which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaid, was this, <hi>That every proper Political Church muſt have a Conſtitutive Head,</hi> and the Doctor both leaves out the words <hi>Proper, Political,</hi> and brings in the term <hi>Viſible: Therefore the Catholick Church</hi> (ſays he) <hi>muſt have a Conſtitutive Viſible Head.</hi> The <hi>Interpoſer</hi> now to take off this ſhame from the Doctor, hath taken the right courſe (I ſay) for he comes and does worſe, and that is, puts in a fifth term alſo into the Argument. <hi>If every Church</hi> (when he ſhould ſay every Proper Political Church only, if he ſpeaks to Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) muſt have a Viſible Subordinate Conſtitutive Head, then muſt the Catholick Church have ſuch a one:</hi> But <hi>that</hi> having no ſuch a one, a <hi>National</hi> Church as well as the <hi>Catholick</hi> may be without a Conſtitutive Head. This is the Reaſoning in the ſumm (I ſay in the <hi>ſum,</hi> for it is no matter for more of his <hi>words</hi>) that puts me and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> (as he ſays) at ſuch a loſs, as is <hi>irrecoverable.</hi> And does he not indeed take off the ſhame from the Doctor by taking it thus upon himſelf? Suppoſe another ſhould put a ſixth term into the Argument, and argue, <hi>If no Church can be a true Viſible Church without a Viſible Subordinate</hi> Monarchical <hi>Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Head, then cannot the Catholick Church viſible be a true Church without a Viſible Subordinate</hi> Monarchical <hi>Conſtitutive Head,</hi> Who could doubt now any longer but Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> muſt yield to a plain Confutation, or bring in the Pope preſently without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy? But did Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> I pray lay down the <hi>Propoſition,</hi> from which, this <hi>Conſequence,</hi> by this means, is indeed made unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? No, you will ſay this were to wrong Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to put in the term <hi>Monarchical</hi> (and would ſpoil this mans <hi>Goverment by Conſent</hi> quite:) I ſay likewiſe, that this Author wrongs him to put in this term <hi>Subordinate,</hi> and the Doctor by putting in the term <hi>Viſible.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath neither of theſe terms in his Aſſertion, and if you cannot argue from what he hath ſaid that the <hi>Pope</hi> is Head of the <hi>Catholick Church Viſible,</hi> you cnanot, argue from him that <hi>it</hi> hath any <hi>Subordinate</hi> Head, or <hi>Viſible,</hi> but a <hi>Conſtitutive</hi> Head only, whether <hi>Viſible</hi> or <hi>Inviſible.</hi> It is nothing elſe but the Fallacy whereby the Opponent puts in more into the Argument then is granted by the Reſpondent (which I
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61768:77"/>think we called at the Univerſity <hi>Fallacia plurium interrogationum vel dictionum,</hi> for whether the diverſe things are <hi>interrogated</hi> or <hi>argued</hi> the Paralogiſm is the ſame,) that hath made all this pother as this man phraſes it, which ſeeing it is on their ſide, I will give over any farther perſuit of this Chapter.</p>
            <p>There is one thing only, and that is the main thing not to be omitted. The Dean in his Determination of this point does hold that <hi>Conſent is ſufficient to the making a National Church,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding by that <hi>Conſent,</hi> a Conſent to be of it. The Deans De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender holds the Church to be a Government by <hi>Conſent,</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by it the <hi>Conſent of the Biſhops.</hi> Theſe are two contrary things, the one making the Church <hi>not Political,</hi> and the other makes it an <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> and yet intends to juſtifie the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. But neither of them are in the right. The Church of <hi>England,</hi> is not a Church by <hi>Conſent onely</hi> without a Head, nor <hi>a Government by Conſent,</hi> by the Colledge of Biſhops: but it is a Political Church with a Conſtitutive Regent part, which is the King, according to my Papers.</p>
            <p>That the King is the Head of it appears by the Statute that declares him <hi>Head</hi> of the Church, as it is called <hi>the Church of England.</hi> It appears by other <hi>Acts</hi> that give him the ſame Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy the Pope uſurped. It appears by the Firſt Fruits and Tenths of all Benefices given him as the Supream Head of the Church. It appears by <hi>Cromwell</hi> who was made <hi>Henry</hi> the Eigths Vicar General and Vicegerent, and ſate in the <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> as Perſonating the Head of it. It appears by this Reaſon of my Book. Where the Rights of Majeſty are, there muſt the Headſhip be placed. <hi>Legiſlation</hi> and the <hi>Laſt appeal</hi> belong to him. It is the King gives Authority to the Canons, in ſo much as when a Law cannot paſs without a Parliament, the <hi>Canons</hi> becomes valid by the Kings own Ratification. And there can be no Appeal in any Eccleſiaſtical cauſe from the King. Again, it appears moſt unanimouſly by the Miniſters Prayers every Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, giving him the Title of Supream Head, and by the Oaths of Supremacy and Alleigance. If the King be not the Head ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, then muſt the Clergy generally be both Lyars and Perjured Perſons.</p>
            <p>From this truth then (which is beyond oppoſition) it follows, that a National Church is of Humane appointment and not of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61768:77"/>Divine right that is indiſpenſible: It follows that it belongs not to the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the <hi>Church of Chriſt</hi> to be <hi>National,</hi> but that this is a conſideration <hi>accidental</hi> to it. It follows that ſuch a Church may receive its Conſtitution at firſt, and a new form or mould at any time, as is moſt convenient to the State, and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to the glory of God in the good of the People. It follows that a Reformation of the Government of our Church by the introducing ſome ſuch new form into it as ſhall be <hi>more</hi> condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to the ends of Holineſs and Peace <hi>than</hi> the preſent Form does, were a moſt deſireable thing, and fit to be tendred to the Wiſdom of Parliament. It follows finally that ſeeing the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del that is hammering by this Author is propoſed as ſtrictly of Divine Right, which is therefore the moſt direfull Schiſmatical Scheme that can be propoſed in regard to Diſſenters, excluding them thereby out of the body of Chriſt, and conſequently from ſalvation, beſides dangerous to the Supremacy of the Magiſtrate, and unanſwerably faulty in many reſpects, ſo that it cannot be received or indured, it is fit that a model more agreeable to the power which is proper to Kings, and leſs exceptionable in regard to the Conſcience of the Subject, were exhibited in the room of it; and if it be ſuch as would make the <hi>Prelates</hi> onely the <hi>Kings</hi> Officers (<hi>to execute under him ſuch Government of the Church as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to Kings,</hi> as this Author ſo well expreſſes it, (p. 275.) ſo as the Nonconformiſt and Conformiſt may ſhare: I ſhall not for the diſlike of any one or two men, or party (who are deſigning an Antipodes to it) be at all out of love with it. And ſeeing there is a draught to this purpoſe which he alludes to, and (whatſoever the humor be) does ſtyle an <hi>ingenious propoſal,</hi> I adviſe that it be preſerved and inſerted therefore at the end of the Book if you Print it. The Paper (you know) was prepared againſt the Sitting of the laſt Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and Entituled <hi>Materials for Union.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I have done about my ſelf, you may expect from me ſome more general cenſure of the Author and his Book, which I was willing to decline.</p>
            <p>For the Author (whatſoever he elſe be) I take him to be a man of Ability that requires our regard. By his Stile and Undertaking, I gueſs him to be a man of younger age, (ſo I hear and believe) though by his reading and compaſs he fetches for the making good his Notion, he may be ſome graver Perſon. In the ſmall
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61768:78"/>game he plays with me I perceive he hath hit me, and I ought not to like him the worſe for that. It is where I lay open to him, and left him a blot. But for the defence he makes of the Doctor againſt me, I think he hath failed in his caſt, and thrown out. He is a <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>n I count hath a <hi>Proud Pen,</hi> and I am not moved at that: but the Doctor whoſe Pen is more Prudential, ſeemed to me to have his <hi>contempt within,</hi> and that moved me, do what I could, and made me write as I did. There are many (I believe) will think that this man hath deſpiſed me ſo much that it ſhould move me: but I do not think it ſo much. The man is a bold inſolent man, and it is (I think) the taking a ferocious liberty, rather then ſhewing diſdain. He hath uſed Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> like a very dog, and when I methinks am but ſomething rightly ſerved, why ſhould I care how he uſes me? I will do nothing more to deſerve it, and if he deſpiſes me, I know then how to be even with him, I wont care if he does.</p>
            <p>For the Book, I think the Bookſeller hath done his part. The Paper and Print is to be like't: but for the matter I think it to dear at the price. Five Shillings (I muſt tell him with ſome diſpleaſure) is too unreaſonable much for ſuch Controverſie. There are three or four things more particularly I have obſerved in the Reading it.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place I obſerve the Deſign which appears to be in hand. A deſign which ſeems ſpecious, being for Union: but that Union is of the Church of <hi>England</hi> with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Caſſandrian</hi> way, not a Union of Proteſtant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters and the Conformiſts with one another. On the contrary, this Gentleman thus diſcourſes. The Chriſtian Church through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole world is One. The Unity of this Church Catholick lies in One Communion. This Communion is exerciſed in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches. There are no true Particular Churches of Chriſts Inſtitution, and parts of that Catholick, but they muſt have Biſhops. Every man conſequently that is not in Communion with his Biſhop, is out of the true Catholick Church which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of ſuch parts, and ſo not only a Schiſmatick, but cut off from Salvation. Either this Author now is aware of this Doctrine or not: If not, as ſoon as he comes to be, he will be aſhamed of it: if he already be, he may be aſhamed to own ſuch Doctrine as this is.</p>
            <pb n="141" facs="tcp:61768:78"/>
            <p>In the next place I obſerve a little, how conſiſtent he is in this Doctrine. For when he hath beſtowed a whole Chapter (p. 164.) to tell us that the Unity of the Univerſal Chriſtian Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in <hi>one Communion,</hi> and deſcends to explain that Communion by a Communication of the ſame Divine Service (for when Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> is ſpeaking of a Communion between the Churches in Faith and Love, <hi>He ought to have added</hi> (ſays he) <hi>in Religious Worſhip, for without this there is no Chriſtian Communion,</hi> (p, 446.) which he alſo urges ſo far as to make a forſaking Communion with the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be a cutting a man quite off from the Church of Chriſt; and yet if you turn to <hi>p.</hi> 305. you ſhall find theſe words. <hi>The Nature and Eſſence of the Church does not conſiſt in Religious Aſſemblies— but it is a Covenant Relation to Chriſt which Conſtitutes the Church.</hi> Here then we have ſounder Doctrine, for theſe two are different things. If an entring into Covenant with Chriſt is that really which Conſtitues a man a member, and unites him to the Body, then is it not this <hi>One Communion</hi> wherein the Unity of that Body does conſiſt. A man may give himſelf up to Chriſt I hope, who yet does not, and cannot communicate with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and though he own not the Biſhops, may be a Chriſtian for all that.</p>
            <p>In the third place I obſerve this, that when he hath ſaid ſome things well about the Text which the Doctor choſe for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon (p. 447, 448.) yet is he very unſatisfactory in bringing off the Doctor, or vindicating his judgment in his choice of it for his purpoſe. There were ſome in the Apoſtles time that thought the Jewiſh Law ſtill obligatory, and that they ſhould ſin againſt God if they did not keep it: and there were others underſtood the liberty they had from it by the Goſpel. The <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe are called the <hi>weak brother,</hi> the <hi>laſt</hi> the <hi>perfect.</hi> The advice the Apoſtles gives to the <hi>perfect</hi> is to uſe and enjoy that liberty which the Goſpel brought them: The advice he gives the <hi>weak,</hi> is to wait till God ſhould reveal to them the knowledg of this liberty. And in the mean while that they ſhould forbear, ſeeing, <hi>To them who eſteem any thing to be ſin, it is ſin:</hi> and this he preſſes ſtill ſo far, and with ſuch exceeding caution that the ſtrong Chriſtian himſelf muſt refrain his liberty for their ſakes, in caſe that by his example he ſhall give them occaſion to doe the ſame thing, which in regard to their not yet ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61768:79"/>formed conſciences would be ſin, and deſtroy their ſouls. This is the certain ſenſe and diffuſive doctrine of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtles. I will come then to the Doctors Text, <hi>Whereto we have attained let us walk by the ſame rule, let us mind the ſame thing,</hi> and I muſt ask his Defender whether the <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> Chriſtian (as before explained) be here both included, I mean whether both of theſe are alike required in the Text to <hi>walk by the ſame rule?</hi> This Author does hold it, and he frames ſuch an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the words as he muſt hold it: but I deny it, and that interpretation therefore muſt be counterfeit. By <hi>walking by the ſame rule</hi> he underſtands the <hi>maintaining Church Communion,</hi> and this Communion with the Church he counts muſt be held, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it be we differ. This is therefore a fictitious and certain falſe application or explication of the Text, for it is directly contrary to the ſcope of that Doctrine which I have but now delivered as the ſumme or ſubſtance of the Apoſtle in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles altogether. I ſay alſo that this is manifeſtly here deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of reaſon. The Apoſtle requires that all Chriſtians ſhould <hi>walk by the ſame rule in things whereto they have attained,</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt walk by the ſame rule in things whereto they have <hi>not attained.</hi> Such is his force. This <hi>walking by the ſame rule</hi> I am perſwaded is a phraſe or expreſſion onely, ſignifying <hi>the doing as others doe.</hi> Now becauſe they that had the knowledg of their liberty might doe as others did, and were to uſe it, muſt thoſe that had not that knowledg do ſo likewiſe? The contrary is apparent, for they ſhall ſin againſt their conſciences if they doe. The like caſe is here. The Conformiſt among us looks upon all and every of thoſe things that are injoyned about Uniformity in the Church to be lawfull, and he values himſelf for <hi>perfect</hi> in this diſcerning indifferent things, but the Nonconformiſt thinks theſe things unlawfull, and that he ſhall ſin if he yields to them, and what if herein he be <hi>weak,</hi> muſt the weak and perfect, muſt both theſe here now <hi>walk by the ſame rule,</hi> or <hi>do as one another do?</hi> Nay muſt there be a Rule made on purpoſe by Authority about theſe very things wherein the difference lies to force them to act both alike, when one of them (if they do) cannot poſſibly act in faith, and ſo muſt needs ſin? Nothing more contrary to what I have laid down, Nothing more contrary to the Doctrine of the Apoſtle. I will add, if by this <hi>Rule</hi> there be more meant then
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61768:79"/>a Phraſe, and ſome Rule he will account there muſt be, I would fain know why this <hi>Rule</hi> ſhould be any other then that of the ſame Apoſtle otherwhere, <hi>As many as walk according to this rule, peace be upon them and the Iſrael of God.</hi> And what is that <hi>Rule,</hi> but Chriſtianity it ſelf, the great Rule of the Chriſtian Religion, or Doctrine of the Goſpel? And what then will follow from thence! The Doctor I remember reflects upon my <hi>Peaceable Deſign</hi> for being called an <hi>Anſwer to his Sermon:</hi> I will undertake now upon this Suppoſition, that, <hi>that Title</hi> was as <hi>fit</hi> for <hi>my Book,</hi> as <hi>this Text</hi> was for <hi>his Sermon.</hi> Becauſe we muſt walk according to the general rule of the Chriſtian Religion, in all things that are required of us, as we attain to the knowledg thereof, Therefore we muſt Conform to the Canons and Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> This is the Doctors Sermon upon that Text; and I will tell you the Inference now of his Defender upon that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Therefore muſt all that <hi>Conform not,</hi> in the excluding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from Communion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded alſo out of the Catholick Church, and conſequently out of the Kingdome of Heaven.</p>
            <p>By the way, ſince I wrote this, I was reading Doctor <hi>Owen,</hi> and I find that he falls in with the laſt Interpretation of the <hi>Rule,</hi> and he hath theſe words upon it. <hi>Let the Apoſtles rule be produced</hi> (ſays he) <hi>with any probability of proof to be his, and we are ready to ſubſcribe and conform to it.</hi> To which Doctor <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet</hi> Replies, <q>This is the Apoſtles rule, to go as far as they can, and if they can go no farther to ſit down, and not to break the peace of the Church.</q> Unto this Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> Anſwers, <hi>The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles rule is not that we ſhould go as far as we can, but that ſo far as we have attained we muſt walk by the ſame rule.</hi> I interpoſe here and ſay to the Doctor, This <hi>is,</hi> this <hi>muſt</hi> be the rule of the Apoſtle, ſuppoſing that rule be meant as he underſtands it, that is, of the <hi>great rule of faith and love,</hi> or law of the Goſpel. For this is part of <hi>that Rule.</hi> It is part of <hi>that love</hi> we owe the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and our Conforming Brethren <hi>to go as far as we can,</hi> or to come as near as we can to them. But I anſwer then to the Dean, It is part alſo of the ſame Rule <hi>to go no farther then we can.</hi> Our duty of <hi>love</hi> requires the <hi>one:</hi> Our duty of <hi>faith</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the <hi>other.</hi> We may not doe any thing which we cannot doe in faith but we break the rule as it is the <hi>rule of faith,</hi> as well
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:61768:80"/>as if we do not doe what we can, we ſhall break the rule, as it is the <hi>rule of love.</hi> Whatſoever is not of faith is ſin. Now when the Dean hereupon goes on, and teaches us, that <hi>we muſt ſit down and not break the peace of the Church when we can go no farther,</hi> I Reply, there is a breaking the peace of the Church in <hi>his</hi> ſenſe, or in <hi>òurs.</hi> If we underſtand <hi>breaking the peace of the Church</hi> in his ſenſe, which is going from the Church to our Meetings, I ſay he is out, and that we muſt <hi>break the peace of the Church</hi> if this be the breaking it, for this is that which is required of us in that branch of the Rule, that <hi>we muſt go no farther then we can:</hi> But when we go to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Meetings and leave the Church in this caſe (where we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a man cannot act <hi>in faith,</hi> or with perſwaſion in his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that it is lawful for him to go thither,) it is no breaking the peace of the Church in our ſenſe, but a part of our duty (wee ſay) of going <hi>no farther then we can.</hi> We go as far as we can with them in holding the ſame Doctrine and Sacraments, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging them as true Churches, maintaining a Communion in love with them, and doing all the good offices we can to them, and when we <hi>can go no farther,</hi> in this lyes our duty of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>no farther then we can,</hi> that we meet for worſhip otherwhere. To aſſemble (I ſay) for worſhip is one part of the rule: Not to aſſemble, (but to forbear any thing,) when we cannot act in faith, is another part of the rule: Put them both together and it comes to this, that, To go to other meetings when we cannot go to Church muſt be walking by the rule (if this rule be the great rule of faith and of love) out of queſtion. This I ſpeak in the perſon of Doctor <hi>Owen,</hi> who can and do go to Church my ſelf: but there is one eminent thing ſaid by that eminent great man, and very much accompliſhed Doctor. <hi>We do and ſhall abide by this Principle</hi> (p. 250.) <hi>that Communion in faith and love with the adminiſtration of the ſame Sacraments is ſufficient to preſerve all Chriſtians from the guilt of Schiſm, though they cannot communicate together in ſome rites and rules of Worſhip and Order.</hi> If the Doctor makes good this, he does our work: and till the Dean debates this, he ſays nothing.</p>
            <p>To return, I obſerve in the fourth place (for the Digreſſion it ſelf does but lead me hither) that this Authour does induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly endeavour to bring the Controverſie between Conformiſt
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61768:80"/>and Nonconformiſt to this iſſue. If the Church requires of us any things as neceſſary to her Communion which are ſinful, the ſchiſm is on her part. If not, the ſchiſm is on ours. To what end he does this, unleſs there be ſome body elſe entertaining the task which the Doctor ought, I cannot tell: but if this be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the true caſe between us, then ſhould the buſineſs here that Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> had to doe, have been this, To ſee what things are alledged by the Nonconformiſts as Unlawful in the point of Conformity (whereof there was a taſt firſt in the Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Deſign, and a fuller meaſure after in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Plea) and then to have anſwered thoſe Allegations. If the Doctor was able ſincerely and ſubſtantially to have done this, then hath he decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his work: if indeed he cannot (at leaſt on the Miniſters part he cannot), then hath he yielded the Nonconformiſt his Cauſe. The Doctors Defender ſeeing this, does endeavour to ſupply his defect, and ſpeaks to many of theſe things: but I muſt tell him he has done it in ſuch an overly way, with ſuch miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> ſuch incidental miſtakes, ſuch ſlight and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functory anſwers, that I do not apprehend he believes in his heart that what he hath ſaid can give ſatisfaction. I will content my ſelf with one inſtance to ſhew him this. It is in the matter of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and Conſent, <hi>to.all and every thing contained in, and preſcribed by</hi> the two Books of the Liturgy and Orders. 'Tis plain by theſe words, that whatſoever is <hi>Aſſerted</hi> in theſe Books we muſt give our aſſent to the <hi>truth</hi> of it, as whatſoever is <hi>preſcribed</hi> we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the <hi>uſe of it.</hi> How vaſt a Field then have we here for our Objections againſt this Declaration, and yet does this Author come off thus. <hi>We do not give our aſſent to every ſaying in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer Book, but to every thing contained in and preſcribed by it, that is what we are bound to uſe,</hi> p. 105. And does this man now think indeed this enough to ſatisfie a Conſcientious man in any thing which he ſcruples upon this account? Is this diſtinction enough to ſalve the matter? We do not aſſent to the <hi>Sayings</hi> of the Book but to the <hi>Things?</hi> as if whatſoever is <hi>ſaid</hi> in the Book were not <hi>ſomething</hi> that is <hi>contained in it:</hi> Or as if there was nothing to be aſſented to as true, but what is <hi>preſcribed</hi> to be uſed. Good Lord! what Healers are we like to have of ſuch men as theſe be? They ſhould ſet themſelves to <hi>ſatisfie us,</hi> in ſuch Solutions of our Objections, as our Conſciences being convinced of the Solidity
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61768:81"/>might acquieſs in them: but their care is only to <hi>ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> and no matter ſo long as they come off with any <hi>Evaſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the laſt place, there remains ſome paſſages this Author hath here and there in his Book, and more induſtriouſly in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, on ſet purpoſe to expoſe me, in an ill repreſenting ſome of my expreſſions, without regard to the <hi>matter</hi> between us, whether it be any thing or nothing; which though it can <hi>hardly be well</hi> (as to me) to aſperſe a man for the aſperſion ſake, (when as to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> it is (I Judge) even <hi>irreligiouſly ill</hi>) yet do I readily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give it him, upon this double account. The <hi>one</hi> is, becauſe when I wrote theſe ſheets I think I was to blame, that having written them foul, I could not abide to be at the pains to write them over fair, (which yet I thought, to have done) and then I ſhould have caſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch expreſſions, that now in his expoſing them again to me do not like me (ſome of them), as indeed not <hi>cautious</hi> enough for <hi>my ſelf,</hi> or <hi>reſpectful</hi> enough for the <hi>Doctor.</hi> I am ready to crave the Doctors pardon, which is my beſt ſatisfaction for that. The <hi>other</hi> is becauſe the Author does it out of reſpect to ſo worthy a perſon as him he vindicates (not out of malice to me), and one may think it but a friendly Office for him to do ſo: But I do think alſo that Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> himſelf ought not to paſs it ſo lightly, who hath the more cauſe to be aware of him, and to ſay the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Get thee behind me Sherlock,</hi> thou art one that wouldſt foment my pride, when others (I am to believe) have more honeſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to let me ſee it, that I may be humbled to God for it.</p>
            <p>If it was meerly for peace ſake, and out of tenderneſs to the Nonconformiſts, ſeeking their good at his heart as in the ſight of God, that Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> Preached his Sermon, and writ his Book, the good Lord pardon every man that hath had but one hard thought, or ſpake one hard word of ſo good and learned a man: but if it was really otherwiſe, if it was to appear ſome body, to ſeek himſelf, and in lifting himſelf up againſt his Brethren without regard to the conſequence, the righteous God is ready to take the leaſt hurt he does them to be all one as done to himſelf, then the good Lord pardon him (for he hath ſinned much), and bring him to ſee (though at laſt) unto whom he is indeed more behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (or from whom he is indeed like to receive moſt good), either him that <hi>licketh up his ſpittle,</hi> or him that hath <hi>rebuked his fault.</hi>

            <p>When the Parliament then ſhall ſet about this buſineſs to purpoſe, A Bill ſhould be brought in for <hi>Declaring</hi> the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of Our <hi>Church of England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Parliament is the Repreſentative of the whole People of <hi>England,</hi> and I doubt not, but by Conſent and Agreement, they might <hi>Make</hi> a New Conſtitution of the CHURCH, as it is <hi>National;</hi> and much more may they <hi>Declare</hi> the Conſtitution of it.</p>
            <p>The Papiſts are for one Univerſal Organical Church throughout the world, whereof the Pope is Head by Chriſt's Appintment; and whoſoever conſequently is not of this <hi>Roman Catholick</hi>-Church, and Governed by him, muſt be damned. There are ſome of our late Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiſts are for the ſame Church, but under the Dioceſan
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:61768:82"/>Biſhops of the whole Earth, who being Convened in a <hi>General Council,</hi> are the <hi>Head</hi> that muſt give laws to it; and whoſoever refuſe to be Govern'd by the Laws of theſe General Counſels, are <hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi> I am much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore, in my mind, for the Notion (which is that in the Embryo the Reverend Dean of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſeems to me to aim at, if it could be once well formed) of an <hi>Independent National</hi> Church Political, but not to be held, as the Congregationaliſt ſuppoſes his <hi>Particular Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent One,</hi> and They their Catholick, to be of <hi>Divine,</hi> but of <hi>Humane Inſtitution;</hi> for it is manifeſtly a thing <hi>Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> to the Church of Chriſt, that the Supream Magiſtrate, and the whole Body of a Nation, are Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>It ſhould be declared then in ſuch a Bill of Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> conſiſts of the King as the Head, and all the ſeveral Aſſemblies of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants as the Body.</p>
            <p>A Diſcrimination between the <hi>Tolerable</hi> and <hi>Intolerable</hi> is never to be gain-ſaid by any Wiſe Man.</p>
            <p>It is not for me, or any <hi>One</hi> perſons, but a <hi>Convocation,</hi> or <hi>Parliament,</hi> to preſcribe the Terms of <hi>National Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;</hi> but I would have all our <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> that are <hi>Tolerable,</hi> to be made <hi>Legal</hi> by ſuch an <hi>Act,</hi> and thereby parts of the <hi>National</hi> Church, as well as the <hi>Parochial</hi> Congregations.</p>
            <p>That the Biſhops ſhould be declared Eccleſiaſtical Officers under the KING, acting <hi>Circa Sacra</hi> only by Vertue of <hi>His</hi> Authority and Commiſſion.</p>
            <pb n="149" facs="tcp:61768:82"/>
            <p>As <hi>Jehoſhophat</hi> appointed Officers for Government in the <hi>Matters of God,</hi> and the <hi>Kings Matters:</hi> So ſhould the <hi>Biſhops</hi> be in Our <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> as the <hi>Judges</hi> are in <hi>Civil</hi> Matters, the Subſtitutes of his Majeſty, and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute <hi>His</hi> Juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>Upon this Account, if any of the Eminent among the Non-conformiſts were Choſen to be Biſhops, they could not refuſe it.</p>
            <p>Let two or three the moſt fit of thoſe Parties be the next that are called to this Function upon ſuch an Act, an commanded to Hold it, and then would UNION indeed Commence.</p>
            <p>Their Work in general, ſhould be to Superviſe the Churches of both ſorts in their Dioceſſes, that they all Walk according to their own Order, agreeable to the Goſpel, and the Peace of one another.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible unto what Diſtreſs a Congregational Miniſter may be brought in the exerciſe of Diſcipline over ſome potent, turbulent, and refractory Members; and what Relief he might find in ſuch a <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>al Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Officer as this. I am ſenſible how the many inconveniences (ſuppoſed) of Congregational Epiſcopacy, by this one onely means may be ſalved.</p>
            <p>This ſhall <hi>Advance,</hi> and not <hi>Leſſen,</hi> the outward Power and Honour of the <hi>Biſhops.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I humbly Motion a <hi>Third</hi> Clerk for the Convocation, to be added to the <hi>Two</hi> in every Dioceſs, and choſe out of the Non-conformiſts for the Unanimous proſecution
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61768:83"/>of Holineſs and Concord throughout all the Churches: And the two Provinces of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York</hi> ſhould Unite in this <hi>Convocation,</hi> for the making them one <hi>National</hi> Church, and not two <hi>Provincial</hi> ones in a diverſe Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>By this means ſhould one <hi>Organ</hi> more be added to this great <hi>Political</hi> Society for deriving an influence from this Head to <hi>theſe</hi> parts of the <hi>Body</hi> as well as <hi>Others,</hi> which now ſeem neglected, and to have no care taken of them.</p>
            <p>It were the part of <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>Convocation</hi> to Decree that neither Church ſhould Unchurch one another; That no members of Either ſhould depart from One Church to the <hi>Other</hi> without a ſufficient peaceable reaſon; That when a man hath his choice to be of <hi>One</hi> Church, which he will, in regard to <hi>Fixed Communion,</hi> he ſhould <hi>Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally</hi> come alſo to the <hi>Other</hi> for maintaining this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Union.</p>
            <p>There are theſe and other things of ſuch a nature as theſe, I ſhould expect then would be moulded into Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, that kindly preventing all our ſcruples, would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Nation happy, in the ſatisfaction of both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>An Act of Parliament to this purpoſe, would make the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be in Earneſt, ſuch a Church, as the Church-men would have us ſtill think it, the <hi>Beſt Conſtituted,</hi> the moſt <hi>Exemplary,</hi> and the moſt <hi>Glorious</hi> of any that is, or indeed that well can be in this World.</p>
            <pb n="151" facs="tcp:61768:83"/>
            <p>But is not all this at laſt too <hi>Eraſtian?</hi> I anſwer, No. We ſuppoſe that every Pariſh where there is a Paſtor and a Flock does contain in it ſuch a Particular Church as is of Chriſts Inſtitution. That Chriſt committed to every ſuch Church a compleat power of Doctrine, Worſhip, and Diſcipline. That what Chriſt hath committed to his Church cannot be taken away by any. That the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Magiſtrate is for care and overſight, and ſo to <hi>protect</hi> and maintain this power, but not to <hi>deſtroy</hi> it. That the Church as National, and Dioceſan as part of the National, and Parochial (<hi>qua</hi> Parochial) as part of the Dioceſan, are of Humane inſtitution, and owe their power, and preſervation of it, to the Supream Magiſtrate. That as the Magiſtrate does not take away or invade, but preſerve the <hi>power of the Keys (inveſted</hi> in the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſter,</hi> but <hi>given</hi> with the <hi>Paſtor</hi> himſelf to the <hi>Church</hi>), No more can the Dioceſans that Derive from him, aſſume it to themſelves, and deprive the Particular Churches of it. That ſo long as this Power is preſerved, there is no Eraſtianiſm maintained as to a <hi>Particular</hi> Church, and as to the <hi>National</hi> there is no danger of it.</p>
            <p>And thus I have offered my Mite to the <hi>Sanctuary;</hi> that is, ſo much as I have, and what I think fit for Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation by Others, whom GOD ſhall make Wiſe-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Concern'd, for the Welfare of <hi>Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is Room alſo here left for the farther Invention of Such, in regard to many the like things as (or greater then) theſe: For they that will, may ſee ſomething more in a few Sheets, in <hi>part</hi> Entituled, <hi>Animadverſions upon the Debate between Dr.</hi> Stillingfleet <hi>and Mr.</hi> Baxter, <hi>Concerning the National Church and Head of it.</hi>
